[You Are My Secret]
[EP03]

3
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,679
You will register for marriage tomorrow?

4
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,479
Yes.

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Tomorrow at noon.

6
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,239
The two of us

7
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,640
will take the afternoon off for it.

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,319
Getting married

9
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,599
is not the same as dating.

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,519
You should really

11
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:12,800
think it over carefully.

12
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you

13
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,920
really know him well?

14
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,840
I do.

15
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,479
Mom,

16
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,519
don't you know him well too?

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,599
He is the nephew of Mr Wu,

18
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,560
whom you wanna introduce to me.

19
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:28,959
He has good looks,

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,080
clean family background,

21
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,840
and excellent character and abilities.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,960
You said with his situation,

23
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,840
he has no match

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,720
in the dating market,

25
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,520
and if I nailed him,

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,359
and brought him home,

27
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,879
I wouldn't wanna go on blind dates anymore.

28
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:40,120
Did you forget all that?

29
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,079
Honestly,

30
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,520
we don't oppose flash marriage.

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,440
But there should be

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,520
some emotional foundation, right?

33
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,560
Sir, ma'am,

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,280
we do have

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,079
such a

36
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,799
foundation.

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,919
We're classmates back in high school.

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,039
We've known each other for about 10 years.

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,919
There's something

40
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,560
I haven't told you two.

41
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,560
Actually,

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,400
I've had a crush on him for ten years.

43
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,120
I've been having feelings for him

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,199
since high school.

45
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,280
But he's way out of my league,

46
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,039
so I didn't have the courage to confess.

47
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
[When I met him during our blind date,]

48
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:29,479
[I felt that besides him,]

49
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,720
[I wouldn't take anyone else.]

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,639
[We decided]

51
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,919
not to waste time

52
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,840
and go straight to the point.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,799
[Mom,]

54
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,680
[dad,]

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,720
give me the household registration.

56
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:42,759
Besides, I'm getting married,

57
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,919
aren't you both happy?

58
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,039
Then I won't have to keep urging

59
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,520
you two

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,560
to set me up on blind dates.

61
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,319
Yuheng,

62
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,280
what do you think?

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,039
I truly

64
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,799
want to

65
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:56,759
marry Xiaoning.

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,919
So please,

67
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,120
you can trust me with her.

68
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,440
OK.

69
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,599
We have no objections.

70
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,199
You two decide for yourselves.

71
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:20,440
Ms Rao, there's a

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,199
document that needs your signature.

73
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,359
Is there anything else?

74
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,199
Once I finish my work,

75
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,199
can I take

76
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,639
3 hours off this afternoon?

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,240
Sure.

78
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,280
Thank you.

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,119
Ms Rao, I'll be off then.

80
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,160
OK.

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Goodbye, Mr Zhao.

82
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:13,999
See ya.

83
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,599
What's going on with her?

84
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:16,239
Why in such a hurry?

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,840
Going to get married or something?

86
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,039
Did you bring your stuff?

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,200
What about yours?

88
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,760
Then let's...

89
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:30,359
Roll!

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,119
Hello.

91
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,919
We'd like to register for marriage.

92
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,200
Please take a number first.

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,359
Then go over there to wait.

94
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,160
OK.

95
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,599
Thank you.

96
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:44,919
Hello.

97
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,840
Here are our documents.

98
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,799
What about the photo?

99
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:50,679
I need it.

100
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,239
Photo?

101
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,080
Sorry about that.

102
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,960
We decided to get married on a whim,

103
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
so we didn't take any photos.

104
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
You can take next door.

105
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,760
Make it fast.

106
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,520
We are about to close.

107
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,359
Thank you.

108
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:02,799
OK.

109
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,439
Give me the stuff.

110
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:03,679
Here.

111
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:04,280
Thank you.

112
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,080
Run.

113
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,479
They are about to get off work soon.

114
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,439
Hurry up. Hurry.

115
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,280
Quick.

116
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,359
Get closer.

117
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,080
More.

118
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,320
You two are newlyweds.

119
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,760
[Why are you being so polite?]

120
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,039
[You're acting like moral exemplars.]

121
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,439
[Think about your past]

122
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,359
[sweet days.]

123
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,160
[Today, you finally reap the rewards.]

124
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,200
[How happy!]

125
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,080
[So sweet!]

126
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,280
[OK, come on.]

127
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,200
[Let's do it again.]

128
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,479
[Get ready!]

129
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,280
If you really can't do it,

130
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,760
just go outside and gather your emotions.

131
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,840
I have a line of people waiting outside.

132
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,400
No please.

133
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,960
We are also in a hurry.

134
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,799
Sorry about that.

135
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,799
This is our first marriage,

136
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,799
and we have no experience.

137
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,720
Is my smile not good?

138
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,960
It's quite good.

139
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,559
How about

140
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,039
considering this

141
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,559
something for the annual meeting?

142
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:51,760
OK.

143
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:53,720
Let's try again.

144
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,160
Alright.

145
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,119
OK then.

146
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,840
Get ready.

147
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,999
3,

148
00:06:59,239 --> 00:06:59,919
2,

149
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:00,799
1, go!

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,119
For marriage registration,

151
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,239
should we also pick an

152
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,559
auspicious day?

153
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:09,999
Rushing and hurrying,

154
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:10,999
we still didn't make it.

155
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:12,640
It's alright.

156
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:13,999
We took the photos anyway.

157
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,400
Next week, let's find a time

158
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
to come and get it.

159
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,280
OK.

160
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Let's go.

161
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,239
Have some tea.

162
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,039
Thanks.

163
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:26,760
My husband just brought it back.

164
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,320
Good.

165
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,720
Thank you.

166
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,320
Here.

167
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:30,479
OK.

168
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,200
Hey, you're back.

169
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:32,919
Welcome back!

170
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,999
How did it go?

171
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,999
I posted about you getting married

172
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,239
in our family group chat.

173
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,679
Everyone came over to celebrate.

174
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,840
Thank you.

175
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
So this is your son-in-law?

176
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,039
So cool!

177
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,919
When you have your wedding,

178
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,359
don't forget us old neighbors.

179
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,919
We'd like to give you wedding gift money.

180
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,840
Where's your certificate?

181
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,359
Show it to us!

182
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,999
Let us share the joy.

183
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:55,400
Yeah.

184
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,359
Let's see it.

185
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,599
I left it in the car.

186
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:01,520
Another time.

187
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,400
We'll show you some other time.

188
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,720
That's good.

189
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,280
Have some fruit.

190
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,119
Come on, sit.

191
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:08,679
Then you two...

192
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,359
Go inside and get cleaned up.

193
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,080
Sit down.

194
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,359
Sit.

195
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
You see.

196
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,799
We have so many relatives here.

197
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,960
My mom is also in high spirits.

198
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
How about we don't mention

199
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,559
the certificate for now?

200
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,599
Don't spoil her mood.

201
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,999
We'll get it done next week after all.

202
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,559
We can show it

203
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,960
to them then.

204
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,880
So when do you

205
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
have time next week?

206
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
I'll ask for leave in advance.

207
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,199
In the first two days,

208
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,199
I have an audit inspection

209
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,360
meeting to attend.

210
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,799
It's really hard to take leave.

211
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,160
How about Wednesday?

212
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,000
OK.

213
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,160
Yuheng,

214
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,400
since you've already registered,

215
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,120
let's arrange a time later

216
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,400
to meet with

217
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,079
your parents.

218
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,360
Sir, ma'am,

219
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,240
I'll arrange it as soon as possible.

220
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,319
Why are you still calling us that?

221
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,360
Exactly.

222
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,719
We are a family now.

223
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,319
You'll have to

224
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,480
change how you address us.

225
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,679
You might as well do it now,

226
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,839
while the mood is right.

227
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,600
Right?

228
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,719
No rush, right?

229
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,480
How about we just

230
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,160
wait until the wedding?

231
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,319
Sure.

232
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:39,760
Dad.

233
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,480
Mom.

234
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,719
Don't worry,

235
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,799
I'll take good care of Xiaoning.

236
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,079
Come on!

237
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,679
Here.

238
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,679
Address change fee.

239
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,319
Thank you, dad.

240
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:51,959
You both

241
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:52,400
have it.

242
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,520
Thank you, dad.

243
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,199
I wish you happiness and fulfillment

244
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,000
together until old age.

245
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,679
I wish you're both...

246
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,400
um...

247
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,280
happy day and night.

248
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,199
Day and night?

249
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,319
How about at noon?

250
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,039
You should say happy all day!

251
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,039
Right, all day!

252
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,199
Dad.

253
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,839
What are you so happy about?

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
I just like to see

255
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,439
the two of them

256
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,640
sitting there like that.

257
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,160
It makes me happy.

258
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,719
In the future,

259
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,719
in your marriage life,

260
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,719
as you live together,

261
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,160
you will naturally understand

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,760
that nothing

263
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,520
is better than being a family,

264
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,559
spending time together.

265
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,240
Yes.

266
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,600
That is true happiness.

267
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,120
In your days ahead,

268
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,520
make sure to get along.

269
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,839
Do you know how to cherish your wife?

270
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,079
First of all,

271
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,039
you need to be attentive.

272
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,360
Keep in your heart

273
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,160
what Xiaoning likes

274
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,079
and doesn't like.

275
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,760
And you

276
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,039
need to love her with all your heart.

277
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,839
Got it.

278
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,439
Women,

279
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,919
whether young

280
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,120
or old,

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,600
love to be romantic.

282
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,559
To be romantic?

283
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,480
Basic necessities are essential.

284
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,480
About being romantic,

285
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,719
you need to keep that in mind.

286
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,880
What's the key?

287
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,280
A woman can skip a meal.

288
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,199
But

289
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,160
if you miss out on a surprise

290
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,319
that should have been there,

291
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,400
then you're done for.

292
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,240
Got it.

293
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,400
Yuheng is an

294
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,120
attentive and patient guy.

295
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,799
You have good taste in choosing a husband.

296
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,199
You're as good as I.

297
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,439
You've only met him twice.

298
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,520
And you're praising him

299
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,919
like he's the best in the world.

300
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:34,839
What's going on?

301
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,799
What happened to your picky standards?

302
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,319
He is so measured in his actions.

303
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,280
What's not to praise about?

304
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
Do you know him well?

305
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,120
How do you know he is measured?

306
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,400
I just know.

307
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:49,640
Thank you.

308
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,319
Ji Yuheng.

309
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,039
For what?

310
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,120
For cooperating with me

311
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,839
to deal with the relatives and parents.

312
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,799
If it weren't for you today

313
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,000
playing along with me,

314
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,719
if I suddenly told them

315
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,799
that I was getting married,

316
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,240
I bet their blood pressure and heart rate

317
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:05,160
would have skyrocketed.

318
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,319
Since it's a real marriage,

319
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,959
I still need to show proper etiquette.

320
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,319
For all possible future situations

321
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,039
or things you need to do,

322
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,160
I'll take care of them for you.

323
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:15,919
OK.

324
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,199
Why do you smile?

325
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,120
Nothing.

326
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,760
I just

327
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,199
suddenly feel

328
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,360
like there's really

329
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
a sense of being about to get married.

330
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,760
Isn't it

331
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,880
the feeling of married life?

332
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:35,240
Then,

333
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,959
what should we do tonight?

334
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,679
My parents think

335
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,559
that we are already married...

336
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll follow your lead.

337
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,839
I just feel that right now,

338
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,319
the transition of my role is too fast.

339
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,039
I'm not ready yet.

340
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,439
So...

341
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,240
I completely understand.

342
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,039
No one can change

343
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,679
that fast.

344
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:01,640
How about

345
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
I go home tonight?

346
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,719
You can spend more time

347
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,480
with your parents.

348
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,439
OK.

349
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,280
Nope, our parents.

350
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,160
Once we adapt to our new roles,

351
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,719
we will see how it goes.

352
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,839
OK.

353
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,199
Get home safe.

354
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,679
Let me know when you arrive.

355
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:19,880
Sure.

356
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,880
I'll see you getting inside.

357
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:23,640
See ya.

358
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:24,679
See ya.

359
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,039
Come on.

360
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:37,600
[Pick one.]

361
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,039
[We've got to meet a client tonight.]

362
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,799
Meet a client?

363
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:45,079
You don't want to?

364
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:46,079
No.

365
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,000
Back when you

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,360
were working in the lobby,

367
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,199
your work was

368
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,360
usually done within

369
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,799
eight hours.

370
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,559
But in the BDD,

371
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,559
what you do outside

372
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,360
of those eight hours

373
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,439
is what matters most.

374
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,120
In here,

375
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,280
you won't have the luxury

376
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,520
of enjoying a comfortable life.

377
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,439
You need to have the courage

378
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:02,559
to forge ahead.

379
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,480
These outfits

380
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,799
are not shortcuts for you,

381
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,679
but just your battle attire.

382
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,880
Whether you go to battle or not,

383
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,880
the decision is yours.

384
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,079
Of course, I'm going.

385
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,799
So tonight,

386
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,799
are we going to drink?

387
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,959
Are you OK with that?

388
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,600
Yes.

389
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,520
Very good.

390
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,439
Remember to

391
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:27,280
let down your hair.

392
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,719
That way goes better with this dress.

393
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,199
OK.

394
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,280
[Let's have dinner together after work.]

395
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,360
I don't have time tonight.

396
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,719
Hi, Mr Yao.

397
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,839
Mr Ji.

398
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:48,520
Come on,

399
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,120
get in.

400
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,880
Please.

401
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,880
Let's go.

402
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,280
[Ms Rao.]

403
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,000
[Is there a business dinner?]

404
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:02,959
[Yeah.]

405
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,280
[Good.]

406
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,959
[You refused my dinner invitation]

407
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,520
[just to attend a business dinner?]

408
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,439
[No wonder your department]

409
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,120
[is always full of vitality.]

410
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,160
[Mr Yao...]

[The after-work life of employees]

[It's earned through hard work.]

414
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,160
So,

415
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,600
I hope you

416
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,160
won't believe

417
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,120
those rumors.

418
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,040
I also hope

419
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,439
that the Compliance Dept

420
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,600

421
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,679
on us.

422
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,840
About the rumors, whether true or not,

423
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,040
we will take it seriously.

424
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,360
However, if there are some

425
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,719
borderline behaviors,

426
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,400
which may seem legal now,

427
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,120
[it doesn't mean they are compliant.]

428
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,439
Please keep this in mind, Ms Rao.

429
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,479
Mr Ji,

430
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,400
are you warning me now?

431
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,719
Just a friendly reminder.

432
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,360
I will keep it in mind.

433
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,279
[See you.]

434
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:19,080
Did I just

435
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
offend him or something?

436
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,999
Did he eat dynamites for lunch?

437
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,040
Mr Ji,

438
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,759
why haven't you left yet?

439
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,360
We are off now.

440
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,999
You can stop calling me that.

441
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,600
Where are you eating tonight?

442
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,800
At Nanzhi Restaurant.

443
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,679
Ms Rao will be here soon.

444
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,360
You have to drive there?

445
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:55,320
Aren't you going to drink?

446
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,080
Ms Rao said to call a designated driver.

447
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,479
If you don't want to go,

448
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,199
I'll help you

449
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:00,919
out of this.

450
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,679
No, I want.

451
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm different now.

452
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,719
Before, in the lobby,

453
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,279
I observed carefully and was approachable,

454
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,400
and that's enough to solve problems.

455
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,439
Now I have to go to the battlefield.

456
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,360
You seem to be quite untroubled.

457
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,160
I have to.

458
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,479
Struggling is just depleting myself.

459
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:19,600
It's better to just do it.

460
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,560
If I can't make it,

461
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:21,719
I can always retreat.

462
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,640
Why did you just

463
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,679
say those to Ms Rao?

464
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,560
Because she

465
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,600
ruined our

466
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,320
first dinner.

467
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,439
You always manage to separate work and life.

468
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,360
Since when did you

469
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,320
understand me so well?

470
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,919
I've seen Mr Ji at work.

471
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,120
I know it well.

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,160
he shared with me the info about the wine.

531
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,160
He happened to

532
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,360
also enjoy red wine

533
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
from northern Portugal,

534
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,479
especially from Porto.

535
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,439
He just returned from the UK

536
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,279
and is planning to invest in mining.

537
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,999
You two might actually know each other.

538
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,679
Is that guy named

539
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,679
Qian Junsheng?

540
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:43,560
Yes.

541
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,959
I thought you might know him.

542
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:45,320
Xiaoning!

543
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,919
We can't disclose client information.

544
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,279
Did he get a loan

545
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:48,959
from you?

546
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:49,999
Mr Qian,

547
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,160
I apologize for that.

548
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,719
Xiaoning is new here

549
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,679
and doesn't know the rules yet.

550
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,800
And she also isn't aware

551
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,880
of

552
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,120
your relationship with him.

553
00:21:58,759 --> 00:21:59,360
As a rookie,

554
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,880
that's understandable.

555
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,719
So, you need to guide her properly.

556
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,479
Please rest assured,

557
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,880
I'll make sure to do that moving forward.

558
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,719
It's Xiaoning's mistake.

559
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,400
How about

560
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,360
I toast you with three glasses

561
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:13,959
to express our apologies?

562
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,439
Open the compartment.

563
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:20,719
There's another document inside.

564
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,919
Regarding the interest rates,

565
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
they're all quite similar.

566
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,800
So think carefully

567
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,239
about how to convince Mr Qian

568
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,679
that he should choose

569
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:33,320
us at Dairui.

570
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,160
Also,

571
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,679
after reviewing the document,

572
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,600
highlight the main points.

573
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,120
Later, think about how

574
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,800
to communicate

575
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:39,840
this information to Mr Qian

576
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,600
during dinner.

577
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:43,360
Got it.

578
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:47,360
So, what's the

579
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,519
current status of this matter?

580
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,600
As long as there's an exclusivity agreement,

581
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,719
Dairui won't work with

582
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,080
anyone you disapprove of.

583
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,160
Also, your contracts with Visi Bank

584
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,400
for other projects

585
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
are still valid.

586
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,080
I believe Visi Bank

587
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,840
would not easily

588
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,600
give up on

589
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,759
such a valuable client like you

590
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,120
just because of someone else, right?

591
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:10,560
So,

592
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,519
as long as there's no support

593
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,880
from these two banks,

594
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,560
even if some people are very capable,

595
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,439
they won't make much of an impact.

596
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,080
Ms Rao,

597
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:23,759
take it easy.

598
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:24,919
I can handle it.

599
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,040
Show me the contract, please.

600
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,560
Do you have a girlfriend now?

601
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,759
I know you well.

602
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:47,959
You never check your phone

603
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,279
when you're out.

604
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,439
Between us,

605
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,479
there shouldn't be any secrets.

606
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,160
Alright?

607
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,320
It seems nothing

608
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,959
can escape your notice, sir.

609
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,560
Yes, I do have a girlfriend.

610
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,519
When did this happen?

611
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,919
After all these years,

612
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,719
I've never noticed

613
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,840
any girl around you.

614
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,400
It's a recent development.

615
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:09,880
When I get the chance,

616
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,679
I'll bring her

617
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,840
to visit you.

618
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,199
Good, good.

619
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,679
Sir,

620
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,600
you called me over for tea today.

621
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,279
Is there something on your mind?

622
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,479
You know,

623
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,360
the BDD has been

624
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,160
facing a lot of issues lately.

625
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,519
The section one led by Mr Jiang

626
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,360
ran into some trouble.

627
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,479
Xing Yu from the section two

628
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,999
is overly ambitious.

629
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,080
He's always

630
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,679
thinking about

631
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:45,919
merging the two sections.

632
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,400
But I know his capabilities.

633
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,759
Such merge

634
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,840
would be chaotic.

635
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,800
The two sections

636
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,600
handle most of the loan business

637
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:57,640
in the bank.

638
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,360
Chaos must not happen.

639
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,479
Exactly.

640
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
Let's not dwell on this anymore.

641
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,239
It's not easy to ask you out

642
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:05,919
for tea.

643
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,400
How is your mom doing lately?

644
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:10,759
She's doing well.

645
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,679
She must

646
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,800
have been overjoyed to know

647
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:15,640
that you have a girlfriend.

648
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,679
I told her right away.

649
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,160
You should have.

650
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,279
Ms Rao, are you alright?

651
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,719
Did I cause you trouble?

652
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:29,800
You had to drink that much.

653
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:33,919
It's fine.

654
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:35,919
You did great.

655
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,040
Usually, Mr Qian

656
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,160
is hard to approach.

657
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,040
I've thought of many strategies

658
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,919
but couldn't win him over.

659
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,560
Until I heard that

660
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,320
his father's youngest son

661
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,239
returned to China,

662
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,880
and was doing some loans

663
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
with some smaller banks.

664
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,919
He wants to get involved in

665
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,199
the mining sector.

666
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:49,800
I realized this

667
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,959
would definitely be the breakthrough.

668
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,519
But this is also

669
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,160
a sensitive issue for him.

670
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,560
Not something to tread on lightly.

671
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,679
So if you were the one

672
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:57,800
who mentions this,

673
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,040
he might feel threatened,

674
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,919
which would backfire, right?

675
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,519
Otherwise, why do you think

676
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,320
I had you dress so nicely

677
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,040
for the dinner tonight,

678
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,679
what was it for?

679
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,360
To sell your looks?

680
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,999
I just want you to

681
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,959
play the role of a naive rookie at work

682
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:11,999
and then casually

683
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,040
pass this information to him.

684
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:13,719
Got it?

685
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,959
Yeah.

686
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,439
So he wouldn't think

687
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,679
we were colluding, right?

688
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,239
Some people,

689
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,040
when they are

690
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,959
well-versed in certain matters,

691
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,040
tend to become complacent.

692
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,679
He believes

693
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,360
he's quite adept at

694
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,239
our sales tactics.

695
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,600
So today,

696
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,999
by overly dressing up

697
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,279
and showcasing this drinking culture,

698
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:29,959
he thinks

699
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,279
you're just a rookie.

700
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,840
In this way,

701
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,040
whatever actions you take

702
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,560
or clients you attract,

703
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,479
would all seem reasonable.

704
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,239
So those 3 glasses of wine

705
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,479
should have been my responsibility.

706
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,719
You shouldn't make a habit

707
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,519
of drinking in my stead.

708
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:45,919
You'll need to meet clients

709
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,999
on your own in the future, right?

710
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,160
Ms Rao,

711
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,279
you don't need to do it. I'm a drinker.

712
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:53,439
Really?

713
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,160
Yes, really.

714
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:55,959
Alright.

715
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,560
Let me see how well you can drink.

716
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,400
Ms Rao.

717
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,439
OK, OK.

718
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,239
You're amazing.

719
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,439
You did great today too.

720
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,199
You're truly a drinker.

721
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,080
How come you're so good at it?

722
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,999
Why isn't there a driver available?

723
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:12,759
Just wait

724
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,600
a moment.

725
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,880
Why isn't there a designated driver?

726
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,199
Ms Rao...

727
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,479
Mr Ji,

728
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,999
what are you doing here?

729
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,160
I was passing by for work.

730
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:27,279
Did you drink?

731
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,800
Just a little bit.

732
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,479
At this hour,

733
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,239
it's hard to find a driver.

734
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,360
Let me give you a ride.

735
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,800
The car is here?

736
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,759
Yes, it's here.

737
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,279
- OK.
- The car is here.

738
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,800
Then please help me with her.

739
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I'm OK on my own.

740
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,759
I can handle it myself.

741
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,519
I...

742
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:48,840
The shotgun.

743
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,600
OK.

744
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,040
Ms Rao,

745
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,719
she seems to have a moderate tolerance.

746
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,800
She's had quite a bit, right?

747
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,880
You're referring to

748
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,239
Xiaoning, right?

749
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,600
She really has had a lot tonight.

750
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,560
A lot indeed.

751
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,519
The rumors seem to be true.

752
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,840
I'm not sure what rumors

753
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,959
you have heard,

754
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,479
but I know

755
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:17,919
that I do have

756
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,479
some info circulating.

757
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,400
But these

758
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,560
are all my personal actions.

759
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,120
I don't want

760
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,320
the entire section one

761
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,840
to take the blame for me.

762
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,400
But so you know,

763
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,320
some people,

764
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,239
and some matters,

765
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,160
require time to settle

766
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,120
to be truly understood.

767
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,560
Moreover, I have my principles

768
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,080
in my work.

769
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,040
I do hope so.

770
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,560
Some people,

771
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,120
even if you've known them for long,

772
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,120
you still don't really understand them.

773
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,400
While some,

774
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,519
you just met,

775
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,560
but feel very familiar with.

776
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,800
Who are you referring to?

777
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,080
My boyfriend, maybe?

778
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,040
Yeah,

779
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,519
I should call him that.

780
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,600
Xiaoning.

781
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:25,800
We're home.

782
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:26,439
Yes.

783
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,840
Come on, put on a jacket.

784
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,719
Careful, your purse.

785
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:38,560
Come on.

786
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,040
Watch your step.

787
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:42,439
Take it slow.

788
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:44,519
Be careful.

789
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,999
We'll be home soon.

790
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,840
Is the key in your purse?

791
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,040
I'm not sure.

792
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,320
How could you leave without the key?

793
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:03,400
Dad.

794
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,840
Mom.

795
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,279
[Yuheng.]

796
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,279
Hi, mom.

797
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,160
Are you and dad not home?

798
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,320
[We're in the countryside.]

799
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,279
[At your aunt's house.]

800
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,160
[What's going on?]

801
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,479
You're not coming back tonight?

802
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,120
[Your uncle will drive us]

803
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,080
[back tonight.]

804
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,360
[Is there something you need?]

805
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,679
I'm taking Xiaoning home.

806
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:31,560
She forgot her keys.

807
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,120
[She forgot her keys?]

808
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,560
[Then she can just stay at your place.]

809
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:37,719
[You're married now.]

810
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,120
[You should have your own home.]

811
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,439
[Xiaoning]

812
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,519
[might be too shy]

813
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,400
[to bring this up.]

814
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,080
[We're not that narrow-minded.]

815
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,080
[After we get back,]

816
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,040
[we'll bring her stuff]

817
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,959
[over to you.]

818
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,120
Alright.

819
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,279
Take care,

820
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,080
and have a safe trip back.

821
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,999
We'll head back.

822
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:52,719
[OK.]

823
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,719
[Drive safe.]

824
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,160
Alright.

825
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:00,800
Come on.

826
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:01,880
Be careful.

827
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:05,439
This way.

828
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,320
Come on.

829
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,160
[Door's open.]

830
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,719
Come on in.

831
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,080
Be careful.

832
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,880
Slowly.

833
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,080
Where are we?

834
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:28,560
This is my...

835
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,040
This is our home.

836
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,080
Our home.

837
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,479
It smells minty.

838
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,040
It's your scent.

839
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,519
Let's go.

840
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:27,840
I'll help you over to sleep.

841
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,160
Sit for a while.

842
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,679
Come on.

843
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:30,560
Slowly.

844
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,320
I haven't drunk too much.

845
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:33,999
Be careful.

846
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:34,719
I can walk by myself.

847
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,519
Come on, slowly.

848
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,919
We're home.

849
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,759
It's great to be home.

850
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,600
Just wear these slippers for now.

851
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,759
They're my mom's.

852
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:58,160
I'll go to the grocery store later

853
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,239
and buy you a new pair.

854
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:00,560
No, no.

855
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:01,600
What a waste!

856
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:02,800
No need for that.

857
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,120
But Rao Jing...

858
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,360
How much did she make you drink?

859
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:07,080
The rules in your department

860
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,800
really need to change.

861
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,080
Don't talk about her like that.

862
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,800
She is very good.

863
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:17,160
Took you out for drinks

864
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,120
and didn't even take good care of you,

865
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,840
a little girl.

866
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,800
I'm not a little girl.

867
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,439
I'm almost getting married.

868
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:27,080
It's hot.

869
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,040
So hot.

870
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,320
It's burning hot!

871
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,519
You look good.

872
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:05,759
I've been meaning to tell you,

873
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,880
actually, you fit

874
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,439
my aesthetic perfectly.

875
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,479
Your eyes are beautiful.

876
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,040
Your nose is beautiful.

877
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,999
Your mouth is beautiful too.

878
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,719
Everything about you is beautiful.

879
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,359
If it weren't for the fact that you

880
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,640
are so good-looking,

881
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,679
how could I possibly

882
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
agree to marry you on a whim?

883
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:43,960
Don't you think I'm superficial.

884
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,480
Get handsy again, I'll...

885
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:53,679
[Yuheng.]

886
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,600
[I heard there's a new drug abroad]

887
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,120
[that's very helpful for your mom.]

888
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,000
[But it's not cheap.]

889
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,199
[You should be prepared.]

890
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,480
[Thanks.]

891
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:27,480
[Is all of this]

892
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,199
[really happening?]

893
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:26,839
What is this place?

894
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:55,520
[These boxes are from mom and dad.]

895
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,040
[They were delivered yesterday.]

896
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,279
[The pajamas]

897
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
[were put on by yourself.]

898
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:01,920
[The toiletries are in the bathroom.]

899
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,719
[There's breakfast on the table.]

900
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,799
[The keys to the house are next to it.]

901
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:06,679
[Lastly,]

902
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,520
[this is my home.]

903
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:09,040
[And also,]

904
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,719
[our home.]

905
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:11,839
[Ji Yuheng.]

906
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,679
Our home.

907
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,000
Mr Jiang was fired.

908
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:53,719
Back to your work.

909
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,719
Mr Zhao.

910
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,199
Isn't it a bit early?

911
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,040
Mr Jiang's sensitive about his pride.

912
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,759
Zhou Kai is someone

913
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:18,839
he trained himself.

914
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,839
He's being dirty

915
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:20,879
is like staining Mr Jiang's reputation.

916
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,679
He was fired because of this.

917
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,879
So who will be in the charge

918
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:26,600
of our department from now on?

919
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,520
I heard a new one is coming.

920
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,399
They'll also merge us with section two.

921
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:31,839
Merging?

922
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,719
And they're bringing in

923
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,040
a new guy.

924
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,239
What a disaster!

925
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,560
Zhao Nan!

926
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,399
What brings you here?

927
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:48,879
Xiaoning.

928
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,239
I'm here to drop off some files.

929
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,600
I miss you so much!

930
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:55,839
How about

931
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,040
having lunch in here today?

932
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,560
It's on me.

933
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,759
I'd like to check out the cafeteria here.

934
00:40:59,319 --> 00:40:59,879
You're really trying

935
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:01,279
to save money for me. Let's go!

936
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,399
Xiaoning,

937
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,719
how's the new department treating you?

938
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,600
It's alright, I suppose.

939
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,359
Here,

940
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,600
these are some new photos I took.

941
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:09,759
We went out for ice cream.

942
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,279
Oh, sorry.

943
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,000
No worries.

944
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,879
I want a bit of everything.

945
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:24,960
Done.

946
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,600
I'd like some of those.

947
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,160
Xiaoning,

948
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,160
have a sit.

949
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,000
OK.

950
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:51,839
Mr Ji,

951
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,719
what's with the

952
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,199
scratch on your neck?

953
00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:56,719
Do you have a girlfriend now?

954
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,399
Sir, ma'am.

955
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,239
Here are all my documents.

956
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:23,160
The property deed, diplomas,

957
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,239
a criminal record check,

958
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,319
a credit report,

959
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,560
and my bank statements

960
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,359
for recent years.

961
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,000
I realize this

962
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,120
might seem a bit inappropriate,

963
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,359
but it's the fastest way

964
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,920
I could think of

965
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,359
to help you both get to know me.

966
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,000
This is quite thorough.

967
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,319
Well,

968
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:40,359
please take a seat.

969
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,879
Have a sit.

970
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:43,960
Okay.

971
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:45,960
Actually, I've known Xiaoning

972
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,560
for quite a while, not just recently.

973
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,319
We're classmates in high school.

974
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:50,440
It's a

975
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,600
reunion after a long time.

976
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,960
You knew each other in high school?

977
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:57,160
Yes.

978
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,040
Please take a look at this.

979
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:02,719
This umbrella

980
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,839
should look familiar, right?

981
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,839
This is my company's umbrella.

982
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,440
This is...

983
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:09,160
How come...

984
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:10,040
Back then,

985
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:12,560
I went through a particularly helpless

986
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,960
and lost time.

987
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,160
This umbrella

988
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,520
was a gift from Xiaoning.

989
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,679
She gave me a lot of hope.

990
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:20,319
I've cherished it all this time.

991
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,440
So you're saying

992
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:25,839
that after all these years,

993
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:27,239
you haven't forgotten her?

994
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,000
Then why are you only mentioning it now?

995
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,399
Xiaoning had

996
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,839
a boyfriend before.

997
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:36,000
And I just

998
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,960
returned from abroad.

999
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,960
The most important thing is

1000
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,560
I know she has been going on

1001
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,160
blind dates frequently lately.

1002
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,120
So after all these years,

1003
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,279
does Xiaoning know how you feel?

1004
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,080
I didn't tell her.

1005
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,359
I was afraid it would scare her.

1006
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,080
I just told her

1007
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:55,080
that I wanna get married

1008
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,359
to settle down.

1009
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:57,960
Yuheng,

1010
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,759
I have a question.

1011
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,679
When you proposed to her,

1012
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,560
did she

1013
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,520
say yes to you?

1014
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:08,879
She's

1015
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,480
still considering it.

1016
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,120
To be honest,

1017
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,600
your qualifications

1018
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:20,440
surely exceed

1019
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,040
most parents'

1020
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,319
criteria for a son-in-law.

1021
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,399
However,

1022
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,040
that doesn't include us.

1023
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:29,960
Right?

1024
00:44:30,759 --> 00:44:31,199
Exactly.

1025
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,399
Xiaoning is our daughter,

1026
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:34,679
but she is also

1027
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,520
an independent person.

1028
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,199
We respect all her decisions,

1029
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,679
especially her choice

1030
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:41,080
of marriage.

1031
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,879
Her preferences

1032
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,560
are our

1033
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,640
top priority.

1034
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:46,719
If she chose you,

1035
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,560
our entire family

1036
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:48,759
would wholeheartedly accept you.

1037
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:50,719
But if not,

1038
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:53,160
don't you think you can find a workaround

1039
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,399
through this method.

1040
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:57,560
We will never force her

1041
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,480
to do something she doesn't want.

1042
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:00,759
Yes. That's right.

1043
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,679
Do you

1044
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:02,920
understand?

1045
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,399
Yes,

1046
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,440
I understand.
