[You Are My Secret]
[EP19]

3
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,599
Why didn't you take the client

4
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,200
Zhao Fanggang introduced?

5
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,000
The shipyard project fell through,

6
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,319
and now you're doubting yourself,

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,640
questioning your abilities,

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,479
aren't you?

9
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,080
You should focus on

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,679
your own issues now.

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,759
So, it's fine being just

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,479
an assistant?

13
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,239
It's fine if you don't pass

14
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,160
the assessment?

15
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,239
Right!

16
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,080
This is my level.

17
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,039
I don't have your instincts.

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,440
Every client

19
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,360
seems to be problematic,

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,160
but I can't pinpoint

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,200
what's wrong.

22
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,479
What can I do?

23
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,280
Is that really how you see yourself?

24
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,280
You didn't use to be like this.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,240
You've changed.

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,919
Yes, I have!

27
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,359
People sure change.

28
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,840
Look at you now.

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,160
You're not

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,240
the man I knew

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,520
in the beginning.

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,680
[Ji Yuheng, you're avoiding this issue.]

33
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,240
[You can't face your mom's illness]

34
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,319
[or the worst possible outcome.]

35
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,599
[You keep saying you're out]

36
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,440
[earning money for her medicine.]

37
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,479
[Then you're never around.]

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,359
[You're just]

39
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,599
[making excuses.]

40
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,440
[Ji Yuheng, right?]

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,879
[I've heard]

42
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,479
[bits and pieces]

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
[about you.]

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,840
[I'm not sure about that.]

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,759
[But I wanna tell you,]

46
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,840
[you should move forward.]

47
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,799
[Looking back,]

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,400
[it's inevitable to face loss.]

49
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,000
[But if you look ahead,]

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,000
[you'll find]

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,079
[new opportunities.]

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,400
[And you?]

53
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,319
[Why didn't you take the client]

54
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,120
[Zhao Fanggang introduced?]

55
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,759
[The shipyard project fell through,]

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
[and now you're doubting yourself,]

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
[questioning your abilities,]

58
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,280
[aren't you?]

59
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,240
Am I avoiding it?][

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,840
[What if]

61
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,599
[I just can't]

62
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:21,520
[do this job well?]

63
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,080
It's the weekend.

64
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:43,359
Aren't you

65
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,439
planning to visit the hospital?

66
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,520
I have a client meeting today.

67
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,119
I'll go after I'm done.

68
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,960
It's my bad yesterday.

69
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,720
Visiting hours

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,039
end at 4:00 p.m.

71
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,400
If you wanna go,

72
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:58,599
you should hurry.

73
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,679
Mom.

74
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
How are you feeling today?

75
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:28,880
Did the lady in the bed

76
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
next to you get discharged?

77
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,280
She passed away

78
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,599
last night.

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,239
So suddenly?

80
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,999
I saw her just days ago.

81
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,280
She looked great

82
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,760
and always greeted me.

83
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,640
The paperwork is done.

84
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,679
Let's go home.

85
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,559
Don't be too upset.

86
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,840
[I didn't even get to see her]

87
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,799
[one last time.]

88
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,679
Mom,

89
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,039
I've talked to the doctor.

90
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,999
He told me

91
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,880
that your condition

92
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,119
has improved a lot.

93
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,760
You're feeling better too,

94
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,320
right?

95
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,320
I'm not afraid of dying.

96
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,760
At my age,

97
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,999
I've seen plenty

98
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,280
of life and death.

99
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,359
I'm just worried about you.

100
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,799
No worries.

101
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,679
Yuheng

102
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,320
has been busy

103
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,720
with business lately,

104
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,919
but he said

105
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,720
he would

106
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,239
definitely come today.

107
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,640
Xiaoning,

108
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,799
I'm thinking...

109
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,200
If you're available

110
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
in the next

111
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,919
couple of days,

112
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
could you help

113
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,960
tidy up the old house?

114
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,200
I wanna move back there.

115
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,160
You wanna be discharged?

116
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,239
I've been

117
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,679
feeling great.

118
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,599
With the

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,119
nurse's help,

120
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,599
I can even take a few steps.

121
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,559
I'm just afraid

122
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,720
that when the time really comes,

123
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,520
I won't be able to go back home.

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,559
This place

125
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,360
is cold and unwelcoming,

126
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,319
unlike home.

127
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:10,280
If you wanna go home,

128
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,919
we'll help tidy up.

129
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:16,160
Don't talk like that.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,719
Alright, alright.

131
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,199
Silly child.

132
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,880
[Sorry,]

133
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,839
[the subscriber you dialed is busy now.]

134
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:41,640
[Please try again later.]

135
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,919
[Mom just said]

136
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,559
[she wanna go home.]

137
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,520
[If it's]

138
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,360
[really her]

139
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,919
[last stretch,]

140
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,039
[spending it in the hospital]

141
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:13,839
[would leave her with regrets.]

142
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,760
Actually,

143
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,679
the executive lounge

144
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,640
at our hotel,

145
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,079
with its design and management system,

146
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,240
is already at

147
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,199
a five-star level.

148
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,919
Once the loan is approved,

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
we'll be able

150
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:35,959
to make some major upgrades

151
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,319
to the hardware and facilities,

152
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
aiming for a rating

153
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,760
that could even surpass five stars.

154
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,600
Given our

155
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,600
unique location

156
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,719
in this city,

157
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:47,799
the returns

158
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,360
are practically guaranteed.

159
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:51,760
I understand that.

160
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,719
I've reported to the headquarters.

161
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,199
Regarding our partnership with Zhouyang,

162
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,199
our bank

163
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,480
is fully committed.

164
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,000
Mr. Chen,

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,919
what tea would you like today?

166
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
[Mom just said]

167
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,679
[she wanna go home.]

168
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,559
[If it's]

169
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,799
[really her]

170
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,480
[last stretch,]

171
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:14,959
[spending it in the hospital]

172
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,799
[would leave her with regrets.]

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,160
Initially, we're more inclined

174
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,400
to work with Bank of Xinfa.

175
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,880
their terms for the loan cycle

176
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,959
and repayment period

177
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,000
are more favorable

178
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,120
than yours.

179
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
But the fact that you traveled

180
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,319
all the way to our headquarters

181
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,319
and met with

182
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:31,400
our direct supervisor

183
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,319
shows your dedication.

184
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,240
As you mentioned,

185
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,959
once Zhouyang is upgraded,

186
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,559
the revenue pressure

187
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,280
won't be significant,

188
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,079
so the loan term

189
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,000
isn't the most

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,480
critical factor.

191
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,079
Dairui is more focused

192
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,679
on enhancing the financing

193
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,000
to your supply chain.

194
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
I know you're

195
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
expanding

196
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,280
your scale in 6 cities

197
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,520
across the country.

198
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,280
It places

199
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,559
considerable pressure

200
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,919
on upstream suppliers.

201
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,240
We can offer

202
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
loan amounts

203
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,439
to these suppliers

204
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:02,480
based on specific needs,

205
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,880
ensuring a stable

206
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,439
supply chain for the hotel

207
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,640
and the steady operation

208
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:07,600
of related businesses.

209
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,640
I believe this is

210
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,000
the key for you.

211
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,160
You're worthy of the reputation.

212
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:17,319
You flatter me.

213
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,360
If we're lucky to collaborate,

214
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,400
the signing

215
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,600
will take place

216
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,719
at our headquarters.

217
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,160
You might have to make

218
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,039
another trip.

219
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,000
No problem at all.

220
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,480
I've already emailed you

221
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,120
the overall

222
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,160
loan proposal.

223
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
Would now be a good time to review it?

224
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,199
No need to rush.

225
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,360
Try some

226
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,719
of our refreshments.

227
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,959
You know,

228
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:37,760
you should relax

229
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:38,760
on weekends.

230
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,039
Alright,

231
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,319
I'll take you up on that.

232
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,280
Great.

233
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:47,039
Xiaoning?

234
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,799
Fanggang.

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,799
Jing.

236
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,319
What are you doing here?

237
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:01,400
My relative is also hospitalized,

238
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,319
coincidentally in this same hospital.

239
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,439
Isn't this the room

240
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,480
where Mr. Ji's mother is staying?

241
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:07,919
Yes,

242
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,079
I thought I'd drop by and check on her.

243
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,799
We should have asked you.

244
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,160
We spent quite some time searching.

245
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,360
It wasn't until Jing

246
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:15,280
asked a client at the hospital

247
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,439
that we found out the right place.

248
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,000
I just found out

249
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,959
about this not long ago.

250
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:21,880
Xiaoning,

251
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,640
taking care of the boss's mom

252
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,559
isn't part of

253
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,959
the assessment, is it?

254
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,559
Mrs Ji is right inside.

255
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,839
Let's go in.

256
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,079
Mrs Ji,

257
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,799
some colleagues are here to see you.

258
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,480
This is Mr. Ji's mother.

259
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:43,959
Hello, ma'am.

260
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,280
You're all so busy with work,

261
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,120
yet you took the time to visit me.

262
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,719
I hope this wouldn't be troublesome.

263
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,240
Not at all.

264
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,799
Mr Ji thought it through thoroughly,

265
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,319
so he never revealed it to us.

266
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,959
Actually, we should have come long ago.

267
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,079
This is a bouquet for you.

268
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,520
I wish you like it.

269
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,160
Give it to me.

270
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:05,880
The nurse will come by later

271
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,120
to tidy up.

272
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,559
Right?

273
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,039
Alright,

274
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:08,760
I'll put it over here.

275
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,039
Let's set these here for now.

276
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,839
Yeah.

277
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:19,760
Xiaoning,

278
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,199
why not

279
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,400
introduce

280
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,679
everyone to me?

281
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:25,919
Sure.

282
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,600
Well,

283
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,360
they're all managers from Section 1.

284
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,959
This is Ms. Rao.

285
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,520
Rao Jing.

286
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,520
Mr. Zhao.

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,520
Zhao Fanggang.

288
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:33,520
Ms. Tang.

289
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,480
Hello, Mrs Ji.

290
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,160
That's Mr. Li and Mr. Xu.

291
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,079
The last two are both surnamed Yao.

292
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,640
You've become managers at such a young age

293
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:43,679
What about you, Xiaoning?

294
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm still an assistant,

295
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,760
being assessed.

296
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
So, you're all Xiaoning's superiors.

297
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,719
Please take good care

298
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,880
of her at work.

299
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,240
This kid

300
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,559
is kind,

301
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:02,760
hardworking,

302
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:04,000
and...

303
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,480
Thank you, Mrs Ji.

304
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,160
I've only visited her

305
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,520
a couple of times,

306
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,400
but she treats me like family.

307
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,240
You're truly kind.

308
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,760
Would you like an apple?

309
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,799
I'm gonna peel one for you.

310
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,480
Ma'am,

311
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,319
I'm Mr. Ji's junior

312
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,559
from college.

313
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,400
You can call me Yuhui.

314
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,520
Hello, Yuhui.

315
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,520
I wish you a speedy recovery.

316
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,959
If you need anything,

317
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,000
just let me know.

318
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,679
I've been friends with Mr Ji for years.

319
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,199
We have a

320
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:43,880
good understanding

321
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,039
in both work

322
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,760
and life.

323
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm great

324
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,600
at taking care of people.

325
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,719
Oh, I wouldn't want

326
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,400
to trouble you.

327
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:55,439
I have

328
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,240
a caregiver here,

329
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,839
and Xiao...

330
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,679
and Yuheng

331
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,600
visits often.

332
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I'm managing just fine.

333
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:13,880
Ma'am,

334
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,719
please

335
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,000
don't be so polite with us.

336
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,240
We're like

337
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,760
one big family.

338
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,319
Right.

339
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,120
Isn't that right?

340
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,120
C'mon,

341
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,000
say something.

342
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,959
Yes, he's right.

343
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,919
We're family.

344
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,839
But instead of

345
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,280
empty promises,

346
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,640
I'm the kind of person

347
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,240
who prefers to get things done.

348
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,160
Is there anything

349
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,439
you need help with?

350
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,959
No, no, it's fine.

351
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,319
Don't hesitate to ask.

352
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,120
Xiaoning,

353
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:42,679
is there

354
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,839
anything I can help with?

355
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,120
Jing,

356
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,959
how about

357
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,600
you help me...

358
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,640
um, get some

359
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
hot water for Mrs Ji?

360
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,760
Sure, no problem.

361
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,839
So,

362
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,559
Mr. Zhao,

363
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,160
take my bag, please.

364
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,760
Sure, sure.

365
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,480
I'll go get the hot water.

366
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,000
Xiaoning,

367
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,039
I can peel the apple.

368
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,039
I took good care of my mom

369
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,719
when she's sick,

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,880
so I have plenty of experience.

371
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,719
[Thanks.]

372
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,520
[No problem.]

373
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,600
Well,

374
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,799
I'll help Jing with the hot water.

375
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,360
There are no good daughters-in-law?

376
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,240
C'mon, look at the lady in bed 16.

377
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,079
She's so close

378
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,280
to her daughter-in-law.

379
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,800
That young lady comes here every day.

380
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,080
[Even her parents visit often,]

381
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,199
[bringing all kinds of]

382
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,120
[delicious food here.]

383
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,600
[Exactly.]

384
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,320
[No difference today.]

385
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,759
She arrived as visiting hours began.

386
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,679
She seems to have no

387
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,320
leisure time on weekends.

388
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,719
I heard that

389
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:34,519
she and her husband

390
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,679
both work in banks.

391
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,919
[Such a busy job,]

392
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
[they must be exhausted.]

393
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,439
I happen to have work nearby,

394
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,719
and it's hard to get a car at this hour.

395
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,279
Let me drive you.

396
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,439
Sure,

397
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:50,959
here.

398
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,080
Wait.

399
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,040
What's up?

400
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,439
I think I just saw

401
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,519
Xiaoning with a guy...

402
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,600
And he

403
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,400
looked like our boss.

404
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,919
Surprise, huh?

405
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,999
I was in Jinghai for a business trip.

406
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,959
I came by to check

407
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,040
on the shipyard deal.

408
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,840
Jing!

409
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,080
No, no,

410
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,439
that's hot.

411
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:15,999
Let me handle it.

412
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,320
Here.

413
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,120
Xiaoning,

414
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,320
I've underestimated you.

415
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:25,800
What do you mean?

416
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:28,679
Nothing.

417
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,679
I thought you didn't care

418
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,279
much about the ways of the world.

419
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,439
Unexpectedly,

420
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,880
you're here to please

421
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,919
Mr. Ji's mother.

422
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,719
I think it's hard for him

423
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,679
to look after

424
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,199
his mother alone

425
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,199
amidst his busy schedule.

426
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,519
I'm just doing a small favor.

427
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:45,479
Really?

428
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,320
I didn't expect his mother

429
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,239
to be so seriously ill.

430
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
No wonder he looks haggard.

431
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,600
Yeah,

432
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,040
making money,

433
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,199
managing the dept,

434
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
and caring for his mom...

435
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,439
It's really tough.

436
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,439
He is the perfect

437
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,759
boyfriend

438
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,840
in many ways.

439
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,360
But his mother

440
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,400
does cause a burden.

441
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:13,600
When he

442
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,959
gets married,

443
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,880
this burden

444
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,999
will be transferred

445
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,560
to his wife.

446
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,279
This cannot be considered a burden.

447
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,880
Forming a family

448
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,679
means taking responsibilities.

449
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,719
Sure, it's hard,

450
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:32,959
but having someone

451
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,600
to lean on

452
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,880
makes it worthwhile.

453
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,840
Maybe.

454
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,279
But I believe in the Backpack Theory.

455
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,239
Relationships are

456
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,719
just baggage.

457
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,400
I aim to live

458
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,640
without burdens,

459
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:49,719
to travel light.

460
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,279
Jing,

461
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,919
does

462
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,999
throwing away all the burdens

463
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,640
really make you free

464
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:57,840
and happy?

465
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,519
Xiaoning,

466
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,479
what are you talking about?

467
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,479
You are needed.

468
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,279
What are you staring at?

469
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,679
Something on my face?

470
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,160
I'm just wondering if you're a burden.

471
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,199
I saved my number in your phone,

472
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,279
and I've added you on WeChat.

473
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,640
If you need anything,

474
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,600
just reach out.

475
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,239
Given my close bond with Yuheng,

476
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,320
don't be too polite to me.

477
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,239
It makes me so happy

478
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,880
that Yuheng has such

479
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,880
good colleagues like you.

480
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,919
Should we

481
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,719
head out now?

482
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,120
Mrs Ji needs

483
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,880
more rest.

484
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,840
We've already

485
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
taken up a lot of her time.

486
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,400
Ma'am, sorry to bother.

487
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,759
We'll visit

488
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,519
again soon.

489
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:57,800
[C'mon,]

490
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:58,919
[you're so kind.]

491
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,719
[Thank you.]

492
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,800
[Ma'am, take care.]

493
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,320
[We'll be on our way now.]

494
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,239
[Thank you.]

495
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,479
We'll be off.

496
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:05,560
Rest well.

497
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:06,840
Get well soon.

498
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,479
Remember

499
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,279
to reach out to me.

500
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:12,759
Xiaoning,

501
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:13,840
aren't you coming?

502
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,919
Her relative

503
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,400
is also in the hospital.

504
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,199
Where is she going?

505
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,439
Let's go.

506
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:22,840
Your bag.

507
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,439
Let's go.

508
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,320
Hold it for me.

509
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,439
Goodbye, ma'am.

510
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,320
Mom,

511
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,959
that was so close.

512
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,919
I didn't expect you to react so quickly,

513
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:40,519
and you played your part so well.

514
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,560
I was so worried

515
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,679
they'd find out about our relationship.

516
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,439
Xiaoning,

517
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,719
it's unfair that you have to

518
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,600
keep it a secret.

519
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,160
Nope, it's fine.

520
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:54,959
Are you talking

521
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,199
about Tang Yuhui?

522
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,679
She is pretty great.

523
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,479
But I'm not worried.

524
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,800
I believe Yuheng

525
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,279
could handle this relationship

526
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,040
very well.

527
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,519
Good then.

528
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,040
All these years,

529
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,519
you're the only one

530
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,360
in his heart.

531
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,800
Some things

532
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,759
take time to see.

533
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,160
Yeah?

534
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,400
I've noticed that

535
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,479
you've been feeling down.

536
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:30,040
Did you have a quarrel?

537
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:30,800
No,

538
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,400
not at all.

539
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,479
Then it must be

540
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,759
a problem with work?

541
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:38,719
You

542
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,600
shouldn't be like Yuheng,

543
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,640
keeping everything

544
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,519
bottled up inside.

545
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,279
In the year

546
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,320
his dad passed away,

547
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:55,120
[he didn't do well on his college entrance exam.]

548
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,479
He was down for a really long time.

549
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,719
[I really wanna comfort him.]

550
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,080
But he didn't say anything.

551
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:08,880
Then,

552
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,759
what happened?

553
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,160
After,

554
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,360
I don't know how,

555
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,080
he pulled himself together

556
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,199
[and repeated the year.]

557
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,600
[I'm not sure]

558
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,719
if he's influenced by someone

559
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,880
[or he figured it out on his own.]

560
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,160
[But I want to tell you,]

561
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,679
in life,

562
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,919
people will always

563
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,519
go through

564
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,999
hardships

565
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,279
and setbacks.

566
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,320
[No matter how tough things get,]

567
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,840
as long as you hold on,

568
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,919
you'll surely make it through.

569
00:23:59,519 --> 00:23:59,959
[Fanggang,]

570
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:00,840
[are you really not going to]

571
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,279
Mr. Li's dinner party?

572
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:01,880
Yes, I am.

573
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,519
Okay, then.

574
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,080
You sure?

575
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,600
Yes, totally.

576
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,120
You guys go ahead.

577
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,800
Then we'll leave now.

578
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,279
Okay.

579
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,959
Bye, be safe.

580
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:06,560
I'll go get my car over there.

581
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,040
Jing.

582
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,120
Be careful!

583
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,840
- Got it.
- Bye!

584
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:17,759
The weather's nice.

585
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,560
It's still early,

586
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,600
let's spend the weekend together.

587
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,719
Did you have plans?

588
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,239
I don't have any.

589
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,840
But even so,

590
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,279
do I have to spend the weekend with you?

591
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,360
What kind of gangster logic is that?

592
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,239
Here's what I thought.

593
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,719
We spent a great

594
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,999
New Year together.

595
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,800
Then a weekend together

596
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,999
might be great as well.

597
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,719
Better than being alone.

598
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,040
Mr. Zhao,

599
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
are you asking me out?

600
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,360
Kind of.

601
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,360
Look, we're colleagues

602
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
and rivals to each other.

603
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,400
It might be inappropriate

604
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,080
to go out together on weekends.

605
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,040
Then,

606
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,880
don't see me as your colleague.

607
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,800
I just think

608
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,640
[maybe we're]

609
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,360
[suitable for each other.]

610
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,320
It wouldn't be so bad

611
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,999
if we share a life.

612
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,360
You want to share a life with me?

613
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,880
You're not that, are you?

614
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,880
What?

615
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,360
Want a sham marriage?

616
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:46,679
You!

617
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,400
Oh no!

618
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,360
Gosh.

619
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,600
Your reaction

620
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:51,479
says something!

621
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,279
My cab is here.

622
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,120
You

623
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,759
should really take a good look

624
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,439
at yourself in the mirror.

625
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:55,919
I'll leave then.

626
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,199
[Goodbye!]]

627
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:01,519
I'm blind.

628
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,160
I must be blind.

629
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,320
How could I be interested in her?

630
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,320
What's wrong with you!

631
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:12,519
Excuse me.

632
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,199
You keep running.

633
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,279
I'll take this call first.

634
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,040
Okay.

635
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,080
Watch your pace.

636
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,800
Hello, dad.

637
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,519
Why haven't you returned my massages?

638
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,080
Nothing much.

639
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,400
Just checking in on you.

640
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,919
Listen to me,

641
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,360
don't forget to take care of yourself

642
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,880
while you're busy with work.

643
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:47,800
Right,

644
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,880
I haven't told you yet.

645
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,279
Qi Yu

646
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,400
has passed the police exam.

647
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,560
[Although I knew that]

648
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,759
he would definitely make it.

649
00:26:59,600 --> 00:26:59,999
Okay, then.

650
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:00,919
I should go now.

651
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,360
Bye.

652
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm coming!

653
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:11,560
Let's go!

654
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,199
Be careful!

655
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,160
You transferred money to me?

656
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:27,999
I saw the reminder on your account

657
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:28,880
about the repayment.

658
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,959
We're not short on money, you know...

659
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,439
I've made a repayment plan.

660
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,360
I don't need your money.

661
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,320
Don't make me feel

662
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm being treated as a stranger.

663
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,840
I just don't want you to be too tired,

664
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,439
[and to deal with]

665
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,400
unnecessary stress.

666
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,080
What,

667
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,439
are you upset?

668
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,400
No,

669
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,519
I just wanted to pay this debt myself.

670
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,679
Okay then.

671
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,360
Don't overthink it, I just wanna

672
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,360
share your pressure.

673
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,759
Do you want wagyu for dinner tonight?

674
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:07,959
A friend of mine

675
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,080
opened a new wagyu restaurant.

676
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,800
There's a sale today.

677
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,160
I planned to order some ingredients and

678
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,840
cook you some of my specialties.

679
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:14,759
How can that be?

680
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,519
You almost ran for a day.

681
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,519
Cook yourself?

682
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,360
I can't bear to let you do that.

683
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
People who wanna

684
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,880
go to this restaurant must

685
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,239
make a reservation 1 week in advance.

686
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,439
I'll better hurry and

687
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,279
text my friend.

688
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,439
Fine,

689
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,160
as long as you like it.

690
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,040
[He pulled himself together]

691
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,120
[and repeated the year.]

692
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,519
[I'm not sure]

693
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:47,400
[if he's influenced by someone]

694
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,600
[or he figured it out on his own.]

695
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,519
[Could this be]

696
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,479
[the girl he kept]

697
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,600
[in his mind all along?]

698
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,120
Xiaoning,

699
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,959
let's go.

700
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,120
The visiting hours are over.

701
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,360
You can't go in anymore.

702
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,800
I just came from Zhouyang.

703
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,719
I got stuck

704
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,640
in an accident.

705
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,800
Next time if you don't think

706
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,120
you'll make it in time,

707
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,279
then don't say yes to your mom.

708
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:14,479
She's been eagerly

709
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,560
waiting for you all day.

710
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,959
I'm sorry.

711
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:34,959
I sent you messages on WeChat,

712
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,759
did you not see them?

713
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,320
I did.

714
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,679
Then why didn't you reply?

715
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,080
I...

716
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,400
Hello, Dr Zhou.

717
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,840
[Your mom's results]

718
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,470
came out.

719
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,400
We held

720
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,239
a consultation with

721
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,120
other dept heads

722
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,999
and reviewed

723
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,840
all of her health metrics.

724
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,239
How were her results?

725
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:11,479
Is her condition

726
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,719
suitable for that special medication?

727
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
[Everyone agreed that]

728
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,640
[based on her current state,]

729
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,239
[this medication]

730
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,519
[is something that can be tried.]

731
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,320
That's great!

732
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:21,759
Then

733
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,479
when can

734
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,320
it be used

735
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,199
on my mom?

736
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:25,279
[Next week.]

737
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:25,959
However,

738
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,279
I have to remind you that

739
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,160
it's entirely out-of-pocket,

740
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,040
It's quite expensive.

741
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,080
[And no one]

742
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,479
[can say for sure]

743
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,759
[what the results will be.]

744
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,600
[So you should]

745
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,560
[talk it through among yourselves.]

746
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,919
We must try.

747
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
We will use it.

748
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:43,320
Could you please

749
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,400
arrange this as soon as possible?

750
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:46,160
Thank you!

751
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:46,919
[Okay.]

752
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,959
Your hair is so long now,

753
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,999
doesn't it get in your eyes?

754
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,320
A bit.

755
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
So disheveled.

756
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,120
How do you go see mom

757
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
with hair this long?

758
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,239
Aren't you embarrassed?

759
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,360
I don't have time to think about these.

760
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,800
How is it?

761
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,120
Looks good.

762
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,199
It should be fine for now.

763
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:41,840
You can go to a barber

764
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:42,759
when you have time.

765
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,360
The lady in the bad next to mom

766
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,679
passed away today.

767
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,640
Her son cried the whole time,

768
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,519
saying that he didn't

769
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,840
get to see his mom one last time.

770
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,320
Mom was pretty upset.

771
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:01,759
But not just her,

772
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,560
I felt the same way.

773
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,800
I understand that now you're

774
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:08,040
busy working to earn money

775
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,479
for her treatment.

776
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,400
But I'm also afraid that,

777
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,080
one day,

778
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,880
after she passed away,

779
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:15,999
[you would]

780
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,320
[regret not spending more time with her.]

781
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,160
I wanna

782
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,759
discuss something with you.

783
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,560
Why don't we sell the house?

784
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,560
[Then, you don't have to]

785
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,840
[worry about the money.]

786
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,959
And you'll have more time

787
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:30,840
to keep mom company.

788
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,320
What do you think?

789
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,239
I'm sorry.

790
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,360
I haven't been

791
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,080
performing well lately,

792
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,080
but avoid something.

793
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,999
You know, mom really

794
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:04,400
needs emotional support now.

795
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,679
Shouldn't she be the most scared one?

796
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:07,919
We should

797
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,400
make her feel more secure.

798
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,600
But her emotional support

799
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,679
is you.

800
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,199
[Plus,]

801
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,040
[this time is different.]

802
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:18,479
[When dad passed away,]

803
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,479
[you were alone.]

804
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,999
But I'm by your side now.

805
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,800
No matter what,

806
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,120
I won't leave you alone.

807
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
I'll be there for you

808
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:29,160
and keep you company.

809
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:41,999
We don't have to

810
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,239
sell the house.

811
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:44,919
And no worries

812
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:45,880
about money.

813
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,759
Leave it all to me.

814
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:49,279
And I also promise you,

815
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,040
I will go to the hospital

816
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,160
more often lately.

817
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:53,919
Good.

818
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,080
However,

819
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:57,640
you should focus on

820
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,959
your client development more.

821
00:33:59,320 --> 00:33:59,959
[You've worked]

822
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,239
[so hard and]

823
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,239
[gone through hardships.]

824
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,479
[But now,]

825
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
[you're gonna give up]

826
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,600
'cause of a minor setback?

827
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,400
This isn't the way

828
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,279
you do things.

829
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:14,919
I got it.

830
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,560
Here.

831
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,040
How is it?

832
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:19,199
Are you satisfied?

833
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,880
It looks

834
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,560
pretty good.

835
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,719
You also need to pay more attention

836
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,399
to these microenterprises.

837
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,000
Okay.

838
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:36,000
[Besides these civilian-run enterprises,]

839
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,279
pay extra attention

840
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,440
to microenterprises.

841
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,080
[No problem.]

842
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:43,920
Xiaoning,

843
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:44,759
busy working?

844
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,040
Miss Rao.

845
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,239
Xiaoning.

846
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,440
You suddenly

847
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,719
lost interest in

848
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,839
customer marketing.

849
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,319
[Did you]

850
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,160
know that

851
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,600
something would happen sooner or later?

852
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:28,759
Jing,

853
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,000
what do you mean?

854
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,199
Er,

855
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,759
what's important

856
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:33,679
is not what will happen

857
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
in the future,

858
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,480
but that you step by step

859
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,799
do your current job well.

860
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,600
Understand?

861
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,480
Yes, ma'am.

862
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,279
Good then.

863
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,040
After visiting the hospital,

864
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,399
I've been curious

865
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,719
whether our boss

866
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,759
is dating Yuhui.

867
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,120
She's

868
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:54,239
so attentive and caring

869
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,199
with Mrs Ji

870
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:57,799
at the hospital,

871
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,199
covering her with blankets

872
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,239
and peeling fruit for her...

873
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:00,879
Mr. Zhao,

874
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:02,960
you asked me out

875
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,160
just to tell me this?

876
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Could you perhaps

877
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:09,279
have a bit more imagination?

878
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:09,960
No,

879
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,199
I've been thinking

880
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,560
that maybe our company's rules

881
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,719
are a bit inhumane.

882
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:14,879
Look,

883
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,440
Liu Xiaoli from Section 2 has been

884
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,799
transferred for almost half a year.

885
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,679
It really is.

886
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
The rules

887
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,440
are indeed inhumane.

888
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:24,759
It's not because of this that

889
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:26,239
you don't want to be with me, right?

890
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,120
Don't have to worry about this at all.

891
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,839
I specifically looked into it before.

892
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:31,279
No clear prohibition

893
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,000
on boyfriends and girlfriends

894
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,960
working together.

895
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,120
[Liu Xiaoli]

896
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:37,920
was transferred

897
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,120
after she got married.

898
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:43,480
Continue.

899
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:45,120
If you agree

900
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:47,480
to be my girlfriend,

901
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,679
we need time

902
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:52,239
to get to know each other better.

903
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,440
[No need to overthink it.]

904
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,080
As for our work,

905
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:57,520
we should take it

906
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,040
as it comes.

907
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:04,199
Mr Zhao,

908
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,319
you specifically looked into it?

909
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,279
Yes, I did.

910
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,040
So, you're not just

911
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,440
messing around.

912
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,560
You're serious.

913
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,560
I'm not one of your young guys.

914
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:20,839
I'm already in my thirties.

915
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,279
How can I joke about

916
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,759
relationships?

917
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,279
I know,

918
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:28,920
entering a relationship

919
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,160
will add weight to your burden

920
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,560
[and]

921
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:33,879
[make you feel a bit]

922
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:34,759
[constrained.]

923
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:35,879
But it won't

924
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:37,319
make you feel lonely

925
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,080
for the rest of your life, right?

926
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,719
[We should embrace it bravely,]

927
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:42,759
and accept

928
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,399
all the beauty this world has to offer.

929
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,520
But have you ever

930
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,399
thought about how to

931
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,000
make sure that

932
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,440
all those packed in my backpack

933
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:58,120
won't be taken away in the end?

934
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:23,759
[Sincerity is the key.]

935
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,560
Mrs Ji will surely be safe and sound.

936
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,480
Thank you.

937
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,440
She will!

938
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,719
Ji Yuheng didn't give up.

939
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,160
Mom didn't give up either.

940
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,480
I definitely shouldn't give up.

941
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:35,839
I should

942
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,399
have some confidence and faith.

943
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,759
Then, when I'm at the hospital,

944
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,679
I can pass on a lot of emotional strength

945
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,520
to her.

946
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,239
I feel

947
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,679
that time truly flies by.

948
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:52,199
In the blink of an eye, we're already

949
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,199
approaching our thirties.

950
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,080
I feel like just yesterday

951
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,239
we were still little kids.

952
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:58,679
How could we

953
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,319
have to deal with these?

954
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,719
Alright, forget it.

955
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,920
How's it going with your clients?

956
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:08,319
Fanggang

957
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,600
introduced me to several groups

958
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,799
from the Tech Park,

959
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:11,960
and I'm talking with them now.

960
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,600
Before,

961
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
I was indeed impatient and short-sighted.

962
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,799
Then I started to doubt myself.

963
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,480
Now I understand.

964
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:19,319
I should take it easy.

965
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,839
There's no hurry.

966
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:21,399
That's good.

967
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,960
After all no matter what,

968
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,359
my dad has got your back.

969
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,040
I can't just

970
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,399
always count on your dad.

971
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,960
What if I get the permanent position?

972
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:29,759
Will I still

973
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:30,679
count on your dad?

974
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:32,160
Take all the help that you can get.

975
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,040
After all, your business

976
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,279
is just about

977
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:36,719
giving loans and attracting deposits.

978
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,759
Since my dad

979
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:38,759
has to do that,

980
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:39,920
why didn't he choose you?

981
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,000
There's no need.

982
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,080
What,

983
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,359
don't you have any faith in me?

984
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,120
Of course I do.

985
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:45,120
You'll surely get it.

986
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,520
Let's go.

987
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,960
The results are good.

988
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:08,759
Really?

989
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,799
[After using the medication,]

990
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,319
[the previously metastasized lesions]

991
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,000
[have shrunk in several areas.]

992
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:14,000
Currently, it looks like

993
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:15,279
the condition is well under control.

994
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,160
So,

995
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,399
can continuous use

996
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:18,480
of it improve

997
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,640
her condition?

998
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:20,960
Actually,

999
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,359
it's hard to say.

1000
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,160
[With every medication,]

1001
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
[drug resistance is inevitable]

1002
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,399
[in the end.]

1003
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:28,480
[But don't worry.]

1004
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,319
The current situation

1005
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,120
is quite good.

1006
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,960
If remains stable,

1007
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,120
getting discharged

1008
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:34,960
and going home to rest

1009
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,000
shouldn't be a problem.

1010
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:38,080
Thank you.

1011
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,440
Come,

1012
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,319
gather around.

1013
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,359
We're having the midterm exam today.

1014
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,640
Class One will go first.

1015
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:07,799
[Okay.]

1016
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:08,279
[Chop chop.]

1017
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,120
No worries, sir.

1018
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,120
I'm fine on my own.

1019
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,000
I think he's on his own.

1020
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,160
Who wants to team up with Ji Yuheng?

1021
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,960
Come hold his ankles.

1022
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:35,040
I won't.

1023
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:35,960
Me neither.

1024
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:37,239
His dad used his friends like that.

1025
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,799
Who dares to have anything to do with him?

1026
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:39,560
[Yeah.]

1027
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,199
What happened to his dad?

1028
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,960
Something bad.

1029
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,799
[Anyone?]

1030
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,040
Sir,

1031
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,120
can I?

1032
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:53,879
Sure,

1033
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:54,719
come.

1034
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,440
[Okay, get ready.]

1035
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:05,279
[Three,]

1036
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,160
[two,]

1037
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:06,920
[one.]
