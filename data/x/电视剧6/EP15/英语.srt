[You Are My Secret]
[EP15]

3
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,599
Go out,

4
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,399
turn left for 500 meters,

5
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,360
and I'll pass a small shop.

6
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,800
Is that the place

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,720
you're talking about?

8
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,200
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,840
Any good places

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,399
to eat around there?

11
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,720
I'll send the info to your phone.

12
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:00,479
Great, thanks.

13
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,160
[Reach out if you need anything.]

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,759
Thanks.

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,399
Ms. Rao,

16
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,039
I thought you'd leave

17
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:07,959
right after I arrived.

18
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,479
Xiaoning still has

19
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,920
some things to finish,

20
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,599
so I

21
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,800
can't leave yet.

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,759
Your trainee is persistent.

23
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,239
Yuhui will sign tomorrow,

24
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,479
but Xiaoning is still trying?

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,160
You used

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,120
to say

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,799
Xiaoning

28
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:24,680
all the time,

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,599
now

30
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,240
it's

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,560
Yuhui.

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Change of heart?

33
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,479
No way.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,879
But business

35
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,120
is tough

36
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,359
and survival of the fittest.

37
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,240
Xiaoning will

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,160
learn this soon.

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,319
After all,

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,799
not everyone is...

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,440
Thick-skinned.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,879
I...

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,240
Right.

44
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,359
Why are you

45
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:43,879
in such a rush?

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,759
Why do you care?

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,759
Can't I go out

48
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,440
and have some fun?

49
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,879
If you have money, pay me back.

50
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,359
How about

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,440
taking me along,

52
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,079
going toward the interest?

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,599
I'm free now anyway.

54
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,639
You're free?

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,160
Go pick up shells on the beach.

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Where I'm going

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,879
isn't for you.

58
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,319
But

59
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,160
where's that?

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,240
Hello.

61
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:08,960
[Hello.]

62
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,879
Leave this bag at the front desk.

63
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,359
I'll pick it up later.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,120
Sure, no problem.

65
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,560
Thanks.

66
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,199
Turn left for 500 meters, right?

67
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,879
[Yes.]

68
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,079
Geez.

69
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,840
Flicking your hair like that.

70
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,359
What's there to do here for fun?

71
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,919
Whose dog left a mess?

72
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,240
Is she aware

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm following her?

74
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,120
Is she leading me

75
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,039
in circles on purpose?

76
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,400
Why do I feel like

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,919
I'm going

78
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,039
in circles?

79
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,079
No one around,

80
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,799
and no phone signal.

81
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:20,160
Rao Jing!

82
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,000
Rao Jing!

83
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,599
It's Zhao Fanggang!

84
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,239
Hello,

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,919
anyone home?

86
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm lost.

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Can someone

88
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,880
help me get out?

89
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,039
Anyone?

90
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,520
Excuse me,

91
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,520
I got lost.

92
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,439
Can you point me the way out?

93
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,720
Sorry,

94
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,119
I...

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,160
I'm just asking for directions.

96
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,880
I wandered

97
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,999
in here by mistake.

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,439
Sorry.

99
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,200
Please don't blame me.

100
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll leave now.

101
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,400
Did you enjoy scaring me?

102
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:21,280
Was that funny?

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,119
Why are you here?

104
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,080
Aren't you afraid of getting lost?

105
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,239
You're pretty brave.

106
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:29,799
Mr. Zhao,

107
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,239
are you crazy?

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,479
You followed me here.

109
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:34,559
I...

110
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:36,999
I...

111
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:38,919
I came here

112
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:39,720
because of

113
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,280
this brochure.

114
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,960
Brochure guide?

115
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:43,720
Does it have my house on it?

116
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:44,439
Your house?

117
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,359
Playing with me again.

118
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,239
It says Rao Yong,

119
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,400
and you're Rao...

120
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,280
Jing.

121
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,039
Yes,

122
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,239
Rao Yong is my dad,

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,479
and that's my mom.

124
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,840
Since you're here,

125
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,320
let me introduce you.

126
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,119
Dad, Mom,

127
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,239
this is

128
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:11,919
my colleague

129
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,160
and debtor,

130
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,479
Zhao Fanggang.

131
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,559
[He]

132
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,880
[reminds me to repay my debt]

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,039
[every morning, noon, and night,]

134
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,119
so

135
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:21,999
please

136
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,919
remember

137
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,520
his face

138
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,599
and bless him.

139
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:27,479
Oh, actually,

140
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
there is

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,799
no need

142
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,559
to trouble you.

143
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,479
We

144
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,320
are

145
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,439
good colleagues

146
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,679
and friends.

147
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,160
In that case,

148
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:41,640
then give 3 bows.

149
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,239
Get up now.

150
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,919
Don't rush,

151
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,520
take it slow.

152
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,760
Not bad.

153
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,439
I've been fishing for so long,

154
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,599
and with your help,

155
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,080
I only caught this small fish.

156
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,320
Mr. Yang

157
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,520
is an expert angler.

158
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
How can I attract him?

159
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,119
Therefore,

160
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,559
casting a wide net

161
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,039
isn't as good as mastering a skill.

162
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,919
You mean

163
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,400
learning a unique skill?

164
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,239
I saw a lot of

165
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,320
yellowfish nearby.

166
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,039
I can teach you the no-bait fishing.

167
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:01,880
It might

168
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,200
attract Mr. Yang.

169
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,320
No-bait fishing?

170
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,559
Without bait?

171
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:05,960
Yes,

172
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,520
but it's difficult.

173
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,080
It requires precise angle and force,

174
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,200
and the rod's hardness and length

175
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,239
are crucial.

176
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,280
If you mentioned it,

177
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:15,760
there must be

178
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,720
a quick way.

179
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
The key

180
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,439
is the hook.

181
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,400
If the hook is right,

182
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:22,479
you're halfway there.

183
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,880
I know a place nearby

184
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,320
that specializes in fishing gear.

185
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:28,400
No,

186
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,320
for

187
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,119
perfect accuracy,

188
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,359
we have to make it ourselves.

189
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,320
I saw

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,960
some materials over there.

191
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,679
I can give it a try.

192
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,919
You can make this?

193
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,160
You really know everything.

194
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,439
There's a lot you don't know about me.

195
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,160
The fishing community is small.

196
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:52,520
Since Mr. Yang

197
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,719
loves fishing,

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,799
if someone tells him

199
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,880
there's a challenger

200
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,559
on the island,

201
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,039
he'll be thrilled.

202
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,719
Be confident.

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,559
You need confidence

204
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,480
to succeed.

205
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:15,799
Miss,

206
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:18,199
fishing with no bait at your age,

207
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:18,959
impressive!

208
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,039
Only 3 people

209
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:21,319
on this island

210
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:22,079
can do this.

211
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:24,000
All with years of experience.

212
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,240
Your master

213
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,679
must be

214
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:28,679
a fishing expert.

215
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,199
Yes,

216
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,919
he's indeed great.

217
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:32,559
I will

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
introduce you

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
to him sometime.

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Are you

221
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,799
coming back tomorrow?

222
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,719
[Our fishing community]

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,319
[has been studying]

224
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,520
[this method.]

225
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,919
[I'd like to invite everyone]

226
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,120
[to watch.]

227
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:46,679
Depends on the weather.

228
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
I checked the forecast.

229
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,760
It might rain tomorrow.

230
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,439
The weather here

231
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,439
changes

232
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,360
quickly.

233
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,959
Be sure

234
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:57,160
to come if you can.

235
00:09:59,199 --> 00:09:59,679
Sure.

236
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,400
I'll

237
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,079
come tomorrow.

238
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,000
Good.

239
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,799
See you tomorrow.

240
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,160
Sure.

241
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,559
See you.

242
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:03,959
Bye.

243
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,000
Is she nuts?

244
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,679
Her parents have passed away.

245
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,400
She's all alone

246
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,039
in the world.

247
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,760
Poor thing.

248
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,719
Sir, ma'am,

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,760
I really wandered in there

250
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,959
by mistake during the day.

251
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,520
Please forgive me.

252
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,400
I'll bow

253
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,679
3 more times.

254
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,919
Good night.

255
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,160
Hello?

256
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,880
[Hello?]

257
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,439
Come to the window.

258
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,959
I'm about to leave,

259
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:37,400
just letting you know.

260
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,760
Xiaoning,

261
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,600
morning.

262
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:58,959
Morning.

263
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,160
Xiaoning,

264
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,959
what's got you so happy

265
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:02,480
this early?

266
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,799
Just out here enjoying the sea.

267
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,520
[What about you?]

268
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,000
Where are you heading for?

269
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,079
[We're off to sign a contract.]

270
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,719
Dressed like that,

271
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,319
are you going fishing?

272
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,640
Yeah,

273
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,760
since the contract didn't go through,

274
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
[I might as well]

275
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,240
[enjoy the trip.]

276
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,640
Have fun then.

277
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,959
Stay safe.

278
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,039
Sure.

279
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,000
Thanks.

280
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,520
Let's go.

281
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm off.

282
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:36,919
Stay safe.

283
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,919
Bye.

284
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,000
Hey, you're here.

285
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,079
Hello.

286
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,559
Hello.

287
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,679
Mr. Yang,

288
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,319
the girl who knows

289
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,959
[no-bait fishing]

290
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:03,480
[is here.]

291
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,719
[Hi Mr. Yang,]

292
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,319
I'm Tu Xiaoning from Dairui.

293
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,480
Nice to meet you.

294
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,799
You're

295
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:11,679
Tu Xiaoning?

296
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,039
You know each other?

297
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,319
That's great.

298
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,799
Kindred spirits are hard to come by.

299
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,439
I'm gonna leave you alone.

300
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,679
Have fun.

301
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,039
Thanks.

302
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,839
Not many young

303
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:25,799
know no-bait fishing.

304
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,520
It takes years of practice.

305
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,360
Experience helps,

306
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,160
but it's all about the right approach.

307
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,520
No-bait fishing

308
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,880
is for yellowfish.

309
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,760
They have OCD,

310
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,919
so anything in their nest

311
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,240
has to go.

312
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,319
Live bait

313
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,679
can scare them,

314
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,000
so using a bare hook

315
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,959
is better.

316
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,679
Our custom hook

317
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,880
is sensitive

318
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:47,799
and accurate.

319
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,760
Impressive.

320
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,039
The right approach is key.

321
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,600
Just like knowing what clients like

322
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,360
and meeting their needs.

323
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,360
Mr. Yang, you found out.

324
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,919
All client managers

325
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,280
will try their best

326
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,400
to win over their clients.

327
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,480
I'm just

328
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,319
hoping for

329
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:06,600
a chance to meet you.

330
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,640
Then,

331
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,400
you'll know

332
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,280
if my plan for your company

333
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,760
suits your needs.

334
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:14,919
Alright,

335
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,520
let's hear

336
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,520
your plan

337
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,559
and see if

338
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:22,959
you came prepared.

339
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,360
Thanks.

340
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,919
So, did he show up?

341
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:35,400
I couldn't get in touch with him.

342
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,679
When I asked him last night,

343
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,319
he said he might not

344
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:38,039
have time today.

345
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,240
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

346
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,439
Yuhui,

347
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,000
don't worry.

348
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,679
Please try reaching out to him again.

349
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:45,760
Okay.

350
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,839
Hurry up!

351
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,319
Patience.

352
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,559
Your interest rate

353
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,400
is higher than other banks.

354
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,120
Why do you think

355
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,319
I'd pick your plan?

356
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,079
While the rate is a bit higher,

357
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,439
the loan term is longer

358
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,919
and the amount is larger, so the

359
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,600
short-term repayment pressure is less.

360
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,400
This might fit better

361
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,000
with your long-term business plan.

362
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,400
Really?

363
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,480
I visited your factory

364
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,039
and got to know your strategy.

365
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,319
Over the next 3 to 5 years,

366
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,600
you're bound to expand and capture

367
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,919
the golden period of market growth.

368
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,880
You'll need

369
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,559
steady cash flow for that.

370
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,719
My plan

371
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,400
fits perfectly,

372
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,319
with a

373
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,719
3-year term.

374
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,799
After that,

375
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,120
the loan can automatically renew

376
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,199
without principal repayment.

377
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,439
You won't have the stress

378
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,400
of raising funds,

379
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,719
repaying, and reapplying for a loan,

380
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,799
and you'll have continuous capital flow.

381
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,280
Other banks'

382
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,360
annual loan

383
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,679
interest rates

384
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,039
might seem lower,

385
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,079
but the actual

386
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:10,160
yearly repayment pressure

387
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,360
and hidden interest rates

388
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:13,360
are high.

389
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,600
As a boss,

390
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,439
you know this.

391
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,719
They told me yesterday

392
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,319
that a young fishing expert

393
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,319
was at the seaside.

394
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,319
I had a hunch it was you.

395
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,839
I'm sorry, Mr. Yang.

396
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,600
I really

397
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
needed a chance

398
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,240
to meet you.

399
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,280
Honestly,

400
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:35,079
most young

401
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:35,959
people today

402
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,839
grew up in comfort.

403
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,120
They're impatient

404
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,439
and can't endure hardships.

405
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,520
But your persistence and determination

406
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,439
are rare.

407
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm not sure

408
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,160
about your

409
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,959
fishing skills,

410
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,079
but

411
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,360
you've made

412
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,919
a very good hook.

413
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:05,520
Jing.

414
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:05,959
Xiaoning,

415
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,120
how's it going?

416
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,919
Is Mr. Yang interested

417
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,679
in your proposal?

418
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,199
Pretty much.

419
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,039
I've done all I can.

420
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
Now it's up to fate.

421
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,280
Well done.

422
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,280
[So, Mr. Yang]

423
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,400
[was with you today.]

424
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,000
Fanggang.

425
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,160
Xiaoning,

426
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,199
impressive!

427
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,080
You've learned to divert attention.

428
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,279
Tang Yuhui and I

429
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,239
waited in Mr. Yang's

430
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,320
office all day,

431
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,759
our butts got sore,

432
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,080
and all we got was a call

433
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:31,880
saying the deal's off.

434
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,279
Where's Tang Yuhui?

435
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:35,999
She disappeared.

436
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,600
What do you mean?

437
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,160
You didn't even look for her?

438
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,439
Weren't you

439
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,239
close just now?

440
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,080
Why should I look for her?

441
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,519
I came all this way,

442
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,080
didn't make any money,

443
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,999
just ended up waiting around.

444
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:49,919
Xiaoning,

445
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,719
don't forget about me

446
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,239
if Mr. Yang becomes

447
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,439
your first loan client.

448
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,840
You'll have to treat me to a meal.

449
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,040
Mr. Zhao,

450
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,999
as Xiaoning's senior,

451
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,679
if she successfully signs the deal,

452
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,199
shouldn't you be

453
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,400
treating her to a meal?

454
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:03,919
Sure,

455
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:04,999
she can treat me first,

456
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:05,679
then I'll treat her.

457
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:06,679
Jing,

458
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,080
Fanggang,

459
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,160
it's a long day for me.

460
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:09,999
I'm tired.

461
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:10,519
I want to go back,

462
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,519
take a shower, and sleep.

463
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,439
You two go ahead and eat.

464
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,080
I'm heading back.

465
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:13,840
Okay.

466
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,479
Have a good sleep.

467
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,279
Sure.

468
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,279
Bye.

469
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:23,679
Let's go.

470
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:24,640
Join me

471
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,600
for some food.

472
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,439
That was exciting.

473
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,679
They went

474
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,439
to eat.

475
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,080
No one will see us.

476
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,279
Why didn't you

477
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,239
go with them?

478
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,479
Someone was waiting for me.

479
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,439
Xiaoning,

480
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,239
done with work

481
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,400
and finally remembered me?

482
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,959
Even when I'm super busy,

483
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,679
I always remember Mr. Ji.

484
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:28,999
I told you,

485
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,640
after work,

486
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,880
don't call me Mr. Ji.

487
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:20,519
Hungry?

488
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,999
I haven't eaten all day.

489
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:25,880
Let's

490
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,439
get something to eat.

491
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:31,080
Go.

492
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:35,919
Ma'am,

493
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,479
we'll have a...

494
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,239
A seafood platter!

495
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,080
One seafood platter.

496
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,120
Spicy snails!

497
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,239
[Grouper fish!]

498
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,160
Garlic vermicelli scallops!

499
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:52,959
Vermicelli scallops!

500
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,439
I apologize for that.

501
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,840
I tend to

502
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,519
speak quite loudly.

503
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:57,840
[That should be all.]

504
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,880
Let me see how much it hurts you.

505
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,279
No need for that.

506
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,719
It's 396 yuan.

507
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:02,199
Here.

508
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,439
Keep the change.

509
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:05,160
OK, thank you.

510
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:09,600
Is there anything else

511
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,679
you'd like to eat?

512
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,479
You locals are the experts

513
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,880
on the delicacies here.

514
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,400
I heard you

515
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,279
ordered quite a bit.

516
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,239
Yesterday I ordered two dishes,

517
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,719
and you almost made me return one.

518
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:21,679
Why feeling generous

519
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,600
all of a sudden?

520
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,999
Yesterday we split the bill.

521
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,199
Today you're buying.

522
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,400
I'm buying?

523
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,999
When did I say I'd buy?

524
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,360
We're on your turf.

525
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:31,840
You should do it.

526
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,040
What's the logic?

527
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,919
As a local, treating guests

528
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,759
is a courtesy.

529
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,479
Not treating is the norm.

530
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,999
We don't have that kind of courtesy.

531
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,239
I won't do it.

532
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,320
No matter how expensive

533
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
the bag and wine are,

534
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,199
you've never hesitated

535
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,400
to spend money on that.

536
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,279
Can't you be a bit more generous?

537
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,120
Treat a good colleague

538
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,279
who takes care of you all the time?

539
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,759
How I spend my money

540
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,800
is none of your business.

541
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:57,959
Besides,

542
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,160
when have you ever taken care of me?

543
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,719
Aren't I taking care of you right now?

544
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:02,999
If I didn't see you all alone,

545
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:03,679
lonely and helpless,

546
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,120
I wouldn't be having dinner with you.

547
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,880
I'm lonely and helpless?

548
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,840
For your information.

549
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,479
I make money and spend it on myself.

550
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,759
I don't have mouths to feed.

551
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,160
I meet countless clients every day,

552
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,040
and have endless booty calls.

553
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,479
I'm living my life freely.

554
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,360
Sure.

555
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,279
You're the most carefree.

556
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:23,679
Then who was that again?

557
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,120
Passed out drunk in a bar at midnight,

558
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,279
crying and refusing to go home.

559
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,640
Guess that's 'cause no one was home.

560
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,360
You know me well.

561
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,519
I don't hold back my words.

562
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,239
I was talking nonsense.

563
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,199
Don't take it to heart.

564
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:39,880
Rao Jing.

565
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,519
Please

566
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,800
pack it up for me, I'll get it later.

567
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,120
This place is usually

568
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,080
for locals.

569
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,040
I don't think we'll run into

570
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,959
Ms. Rao and the others.

571
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,519
Alright, don't be upset.

572
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:52,840
That was my fault.

573
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,840
I apologize.

574
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,519
I'm sorry.

575
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:57,239
Alright.

576
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,160
I'm buying dinner.

577
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,199
What would you like?

578
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:00,600
Order whatever you like.

579
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:01,919
For your information,

580
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,439
you've only got one chance

581
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:04,239
to bleed me dry.

582
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,279
Don't miss it.

583
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:05,880
You won't get another shot.

584
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,600
I want the most

585
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,519
expensive yellow croaker.

586
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,679
You're ferocious.

587
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,759
Alright.

588
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,759
What's wrong?

589
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:17,679
Don't you like it here?

590
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,880
What's going on?

591
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,800
I think I just saw Rao Jing.

592
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:29,640
Hold on.

593
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,080
Why are Fanggang

594
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,759
and Jing here?

595
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:34,080
Let's bail.

596
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,160
I think I just saw

597
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,199
Xiaoning with a guy.

598
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:37,479
That guy

599
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,120
seems to be the boss.

600
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
We haven't started drinking yet.

601
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,560
I was planning to treat you

602
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,040
to a big island feast.

603
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:52,959
An authentic one.

604
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,080
Finally,

605
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
we have to do it ourselves.

606
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,239
Freshly caught.

607
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,360
We'll start a fire later.

608
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,479
This is the real island snack.

609
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,120
Aren't you the one

610
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,560
that people talk about online,

611
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,919
a partner who stabilizes emotions

612
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,239
and provides emotional support

613
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,360
anytime and anywhere.

614
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:12,880
I remember back in school.

615
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,840
You're always

616
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,919
the one comforting others.

617
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,479
Back then,

618
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,560
we weren't even close.

619
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,360
It seems we hardly spoke.

620
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,320
You know,

621
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,239
you're quite loud.

622
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,959
Every time I passed by,

623
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:25,600
I could hear you.

624
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,479
And

625
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,519
you didn't seem to

626
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,080
have any worries.

627
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:30,959
None at all.

628
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,959
At that time,

629
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,239
I was cheerful every day.

630
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,880
The only worry I had was

631
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,479
thinking about how to

632
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,439
outsmart my mom

633
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,519
to get some pocket money.

634
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,120
Full of passion and positivity,

635
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,880
I used to provide warmth to others.

636
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:46,360
Always warming others.

637
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,160
So why did you always

638
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,600
feel no one liked you before?

639
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,840
Oh,

640
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,320
good question.

641
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,199
There should be someone like that.

642
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,080
I just didn't realize it.

643
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,999
After all, I was kind of

644
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:58,279
kind and cute,

645
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,999
which could be considered shining.

646
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:01,959
It's just that

647
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,519
compared to someone like you,

648
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,360
who stands out in a crowd,

649
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,239
it's different.

650
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,040
My little virtues

651
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:07,759
might

652
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,279
need someone to discover them

653
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,080
and explore them

654
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,080
to bring them out.

655
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,279
So it seems I'm quite lucky.

656
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,719
I've discovered a treasure.

657
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
What do you like about me?

658
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,919
Do I need a reason?

659
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:20,840
Of course.

660
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,479
Just like a shell,

661
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,600
when you discover it

662
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,560
and find it beautiful,

663
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,479
then you're willing to

664
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,719
dig it out with all your might

665
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,439
and take it home.

666
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:31,880
Smart.

667
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,040
Hardworking.

668
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,400
Ambitious.

669
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,840
These are all your strengths.

670
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,600
But they're not why I fall for you.

671
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:41,880
I wouldn't fall for

672
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,239
others who have these strengths either.

673
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,719
I have no reason

674
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,360
to like you.

675
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,600
But...

676
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,320
That's all.

677
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,239
Actually, you mean

678
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,519
more to me

679
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,600
than you think.

680
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,239
No need to overanalyze.

681
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,360
You're making

682
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,560
my feelings for you shallow.

683
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,679
Then tell me,

684
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:06,479
how shallow is it?

685
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,880
I just think you're good-looking.

686
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,880
Didn't hear you.

687
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,679
Say it louder.

688
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,239
I just think you're good-looking.

689
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,160
You fit my aesthetic.

690
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,400
I've heard that before.

691
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:26,959
Who told you?

692
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,439
When did you find out?

693
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:30,919
It's a secret.

694
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,719
Who told you?

695
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,800
Who told you exactly?

696
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,239
Say it.

697
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,679
Who was it?

698
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,120
It's almost done.

699
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,320
I want spicy ones.

700
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,999
Spicy, spicy!

701
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,439
OK.

702
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,320
It's your phone.

703
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,080
It's mom.

704
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,880
Hello, mom.

705
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:04,439
Mom,

706
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,800
how you doing?

707
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:08,160
[Xiaoning.]

708
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,600
I'm doing well.

709
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,560
Your dad and mom

710
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,719
cook for me every day.

711
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,880
[Just now,]

712
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:17,919
[they forced me]

713
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,679
[to have two bowls of pigeon soup.]

714
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,560
[Talk to your mom.]

715
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,040
[Xiaoning.]

716
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:23,759
[Mom.]

717
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,840
[What's wrong with you?]

718
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,840
Other people's kids go on business trips,

719
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,560
and their parents call them

720
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,600
hundreds of times a day.

721
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,160
Look at you,

722
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,679
not even calling me once.

723
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,279
Even if I call you that many times,

724
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,040
aren't you supposed to

725
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,880
finish your own work?

726
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,600
Your safety comes first.

727
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,880
Besides,

728
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,560
hasn't Yuheng been by your side?

729
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,479
[Cherish your time together.]

730
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,600
[Right.]

731
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,120
[Make sure to go back early.]

732
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,759
[Get some rest.]

733
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,719
[Don't worry.]

734
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,400
[I'm doing well.]

735
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:48,759
[See ya.]

736
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:49,959
See ya.

737
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:50,800
OK.

738
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,560
Take it easy, mom.

739
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,239
Have some more.

740
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,759
[This place is gorgeous.]

741
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:12,959
Do you come back often?

742
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,080
My first visit since my parents died.

743
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,120
So you have

744
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,560
no family left in here now?

745
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,160
It's too quiet here.

746
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,279
By eight or nine in the evening,

747
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,279
there aren't many on the street.

748
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,160
It's empty.

749
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,080
My name implies quietness,

750
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,840
but I prefer liveliness.

751
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,560
Staying here makes me feel uneasy.

752
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:42,759
I'm more comfortable

753
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,840
living in a big city.

754
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,719
It's not that you prefer liveliness.

755
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,640
You're simply afraid of being alone.

756
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:54,560
Maybe.

757
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,239
So sometimes,

758
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm kind of jealous of you.

759
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,519
Your life is real and lively.

760
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
You are very petty at work.

761
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,759
But still

762
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,959
you're quite naive in life.

763
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:07,999
You don't hide

764
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,320
your true self at all.

765
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,279
You won't feel embarrassed.

766
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,120
That's pretty good.

767
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,279
So are you complimenting me

768
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,080
or insulting me?

769
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,439
Insulting.

770
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,239
OK.

771
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,279
I'm just an ordinary guy.

772
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,040
Just a commoner.

773
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,160
Living a simple

774
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:19,719
and ordinary life.

775
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,759
Enduring bad tempers for low pay.

776
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,439
Calculating for some vested interests.

777
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,160
Worrying about daily necessities.

778
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,679
For my parents, my wife and kids...

779
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,600
I don't have a wife yet.

780
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:35,199
In short,

781
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:36,640
I carry the burden for my family.

782
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,040
For family...

783
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,840
You know what?

784
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,040
Since my parents passed away,

785
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,320
I've told myself

786
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,239
to live without burdens.

787
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:49,679
Don't create trouble for myself

788
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,239
or try to build any relationships.

789
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,360
If everything could

790
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,519
be easily let go,

791
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,560
then there wouldn't be any burdens.

792
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,279
But sometimes I find myself thinking,

793
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,679
if in my life,

794
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,919
everyone and everything

795
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:01,880
loses their significance,

796
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,279
then what

797
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,040
is the meaning of my life?

798
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,199
You seem to be referring

799
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:12,279
to a theory

800
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,199
called...

801
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,279
The backpack theory.

802
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,600
The emptier the backpack,

803
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,279
the easier a person feels.

804
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:47,759
You know,

805
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,719
you're living in paradox.

806
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,320
You're afraid of loneliness,

807
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:56,400
yet you feel life is meaningless.

808
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,199
What do you know?

809
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,959
Women are inherently complicated.

810
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:05,320
OK.

811
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:07,439
Then let's embrace

812
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,239
the complexity today.

813
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,040
Get rid of all worries!

814
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,999
Be happy!

815
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:19,840
You know,

816
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,199
when I'm

817
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,120
unhappy,

818
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:24,759
or happy.

819
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,999
I like to

820
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,239
dance.

821
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
I want to

822
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,759
play my favorite song.

823
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,199
I need to head back now.

824
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:02,519
Otherwise,

825
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,999
Jing will definitely suspect me.

826
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,600
You understand, right?

827
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:12,600
Sure.

828
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,239
You won't be upset, right?

829
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,679
Not at all.

830
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,519
It's getting really late.

831
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:22,360
Just head back and take a hot shower.

832
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,239
Then get some sleep.

833
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:25,360
I'm going back then.

834
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,719
Go ahead.

835
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,800
Ji Yuheng!

836
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:14,999
What's up?

837
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:16,880
Mr. Yang just sent me a message.

838
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,439
He said we can meet tomorrow.

839
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:19,519
Then

840
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:20,479
he'll apply for a loan.

841
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,560
Really?

842
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,719
Yes!

843
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,600
I didn't expect him

844
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:27,880
to agree.

845
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,359
Congratulations!

846
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,319
Xiaoning.

847
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:34,759
You're awesome.

848
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,319
But I think

849
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:37,319
it's only natural.

850
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,359
You're so talented.

851
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,759
He would definitely choose you.

852
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:41,879
Really?

853
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,000
Of course.

854
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:51,560
There's camera.

855
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,319
What?

856
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,120
Where?

857
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,000
I kind of regret

858
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,279
letting you go back.

859
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,239
I don't want to leave either.

860
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,399
Just head back.

861
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,839
I'm going.

862
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,239
Ms. Rao,

863
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:54,319
this apprentice of yours

864
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,040
is quite impressive.

865
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:55,879
Mr. Yang.

866
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,839
Rest assured.

867
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,799
Xiaoning will

868
00:35:57,799 --> 00:35:58,600
not let you down.

869
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:07,839
Jing,

870
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,480
where's Fanggang?

871
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,719
Let me buy you lunch.

872
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:11,759
He

873
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,080
might still be sleeping off

874
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:14,920
last night's drinks.

875
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,279
Why bring him along?

876
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,399
Haven't you been

877
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,759
eating with him these past days?

878
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:20,359
You've got it wrong.

879
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,040
Mr. Zhao,

880
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,560
here's your hangover remedy.

881
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:38,199
Thank you.

882
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,239
Yeah.

883
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:05,120
About that new

884
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,279
[deposit confirmation,]

885
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:06,520
[I've already]

886
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,600
emailed to you.

887
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:08,879
Right.

888
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,920
Ji Yuheng?

889
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,600
Is too much beer causing

890
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:17,239
eye strain?

891
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,080
Fanggang, are you OK?

892
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,839
Are you still hangover?

893
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:35,279
I think I just saw the boss

894
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:37,480
go into that room.

895
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,080
You must be mistaken.

896
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,279
[You should go take a shower and sober up.]

897
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:43,719
[Look,]

898
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:45,080
you could barely stand straight.

899
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:46,879
This isn't good.

900
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:47,759
You're seeing things.

901
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,120
You should cut down on alcohol.

902
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,920
C'mon, I can stand straight!

903
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,239
I do feel a bit unsteady.

904
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,440
I need to lie down.

905
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,640
But didn't you plan to buy a ticket

906
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,080
this afternoon and leave?

907
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:14,000
You're not leaving?

908
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,719
Forget it!

909
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,879
I can barely walk!

910
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:18,719
I'll leave with you two

911
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,399
tomorrow afternoon.

912
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:24,239
Rao Jing,

913
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:26,920
you're the one who got me drunk.

914
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,600
You need to take responsibility.

915
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,560
What responsibility

916
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,600
do I have?

917
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,040
You're an adult.

918
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,839
Shame on you!

919
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,560
Stop acting crazy in here.

920
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:38,679
You're a salesman, right?

921
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,600
And you let this little bit of beer

922
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,679
get you like this?

923
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,719
Get inside!

924
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,399
You...

925
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:51,679
Good, good,

926
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,399
very good.

927
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,560
Useless.

928
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,040
I...

929
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,160
[Did you sleep?]

930
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,679
[Not yet.]

931
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,920
[You almost got caught by]

932
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,279
[Fanggang today.]

933
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,080
[I couldn't just go to see you.]

934
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:51,359
[What are you doing?]

935
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,679
[Without you by my side,]

936
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,879
[I can only bury myself in work.]

937
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,120
Jing.

938
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,640
Jing!

939
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,480
Hello?

940
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,000
Why come to me

941
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,719
all of a sudden?

942
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,080
I miss you.

943
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,160
Get some good sleep.

944
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:38,719
I'll help you sleep.

945
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:11,679
Aren't you the one

946
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:13,279
that people talk about online,

947
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,679
a partner who stabilizes emotions

948
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,000
and provides emotional support

949
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,879
anytime and anywhere.

950
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,560
I remember back in school.

951
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,560
You're always

952
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,600
the one comforting others.

953
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,319
Back then,

954
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,199
we weren't even close.

955
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,040
It seems we hardly spoke.

956
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,000
You know,

957
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
you were quite loud.

958
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,719
Every time I passed by,

959
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:33,279
I could hear you.

960
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:35,000
And

961
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:35,759
you didn't seem

962
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:36,799
to have any worries.

963
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,120
Stop crying.

964
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,560
You only dropped two places, right?

965
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,000
You're still in the top ten.

966
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,080
Look at me, I'm always at the bottom.

967
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,040
Why are you crying?

968
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:47,359
Stop.

969
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,319
Your mom doesn't like it when you cry.

970
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,440
If you went home with puffy eyes,

971
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,600
she would be upset.

972
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,799
I have a good idea.

973
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,560
Just tell her

974
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,359
that even

975
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,080
after dropping two places,

976
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,120
you're still in the top ten,

977
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,719
but I've always been

978
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:01,759
at the bottom.

979
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,960
She's lucky to have

980
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,759
someone like you.

981
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:04,399
If she had someone

982
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:05,719
like me as her daughter,

983
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,440
she'd be in deep trouble.

984
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,399
Isn't that right?

985
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,679
Have some water. Stop crying.

986
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,160
[Smart.]

987
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,480
[Hardworking.]

988
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:14,759
Ambitious.

989
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,040
These are all your strengths.

990
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:18,920
But they're not why I fall for you.

991
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:20,319
I have no reason

992
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,040
 to like you.
