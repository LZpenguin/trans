[You Are My Secret]
[EP25]

3
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,280
Ms Geng,

4
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,879
Please set up

5
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,759
a meeting between Ji Yuheng

6
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,039
from Dairui and Mr. Xia.

7
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,599
Why do you think

8
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,200
he could meet Xia Mingrui through me?

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
Honestly, I'm not sure.

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,119
I also realize

11
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:05,560
that you probably won't help me.

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,800
But I truly

13
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,080
have no other options left.

14
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,720
I can only muster the courage

15
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,560
to give it a try.

16
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,200
Sorry about this.

17
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:16,679
I'm sorry,

18
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,640
but I can do nothing for this.

19
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,399
Sorry, but I have

20
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,959
a press conference to attend.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,759
If you want more payment

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,319
for the help

23
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,440
you provided me,

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
you can reach out to my assistant.

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,359
I'll do my best to accommodate.

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,000
Ms. Geng,

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,960
I understand.

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Relationships between people

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,479
are quite complex.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,079
Sometimes it even takes

31
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,079
years of effort

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,120
under immense pressure

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,160
to maintain them.

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,759
The hardships involved

35
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,240
are only known to oneself.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
I truly empathize with you.

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,359
If it weren't for

38
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,440
a last resort,

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
I wouldn't come to you.

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,240
Are you threatening me?

41
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,280
Of course not.

42
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:53,720
I'm here to

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,919
ask for your help.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,720
I'm not sure

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,879
how much you know about

46
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,039
me and Xia Mingrui.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,479
But I absolutely won't

48
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,359
let our relationship

49
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,000
become a weapon against us.

50
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,759
Ms. Geng!

51
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,000
Just so happens

52
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:13,799
my visa hasn't expired,

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
and the bank has approved my trip.

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,879
Plus, I'm familiar with the US.

55
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,599
I think if we think of a way,

56
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,199
we can definitely meet Mr. Xia.

57
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,599
That's a good idea.

58
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,319
He's always busy in China,

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,280
maintaining a tight schedule.

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,319
Since in the US,

61
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,479
he should have some free time.

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,919
Let's hope so.

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,960
In any case,

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,919
I'll be available 24/7

65
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,960
to accommodate his schedule.

66
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,160
I hope his itinerary

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,240
isn't too packed.

68
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,479
You really have guts,

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
just going for it.

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,359
Don't praise me just yet.

71
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,280
Hold it until I secure the deal.

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,000
I also wonder

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,280
if it doesn't work out,

74
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
will my airfare be reimbursed?

75
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
But what if

76
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,960
his schedule is uncertain?

77
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,840
Are you planning to

78
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,319
just stay in the US for him?

79
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,479
The higher-ups

80
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,400
would have a problem with it.

81
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,560
Also,

82
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,720
that "you-know-who" from S2

83
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,639
might stir up

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,000
some trouble

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,840
after you leave.

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,440
That's true.

87
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,400
So I called you over,

88
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,120
hoping that

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,560
while I'm away,

90
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,560
you can keep an eye

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,479
on the work here.

92
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,039
Make sure nothing goes wrong,

93
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,960
and prevent S2

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,919
from identifying any issues with us.

95
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:14,879
I'll do my best to meet

96
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,160
Mr. Xia ASAP.

97
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,680
Don't worry.

98
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,879
I'll get back to work now.

99
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,199
[I'm going to the US to meet Mr. Xia.]

100
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,640
[Tonight's flight.]

101
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,160
[Where are you?]

102
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,999
Ms. Geng!

103
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,320
Ms. Geng!

104
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,960
Could you

105
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,039
spare a minute?

106
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,439
Please listen to me.

107
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,080
I beg you.

108
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,799
Just one minute.

109
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:21,880
Ms. Geng!

110
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,039
Ms. Geng!

111
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,479
Ms. Geng!

112
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,799
Please!

113
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:27,520
Ms. Geng!

114
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,559
Ms. Geng!

115
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:38,679
Stop.

116
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,640
Thank you!

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,080
The offer

118
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,320
Dairui gives to Weiji

119
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,320
will be the best.

120
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,119
With Professor Jia's backing,

121
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,080
I'm sure Mr. Xia wouldn't

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,479
wanna miss it.

123
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:02,840
Ms. Tu,

124
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,119
threats won't work on me.

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,200
Being persistent like this

126
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,799
is even less effective.

127
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,559
You should go back.

128
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:07,640
I understand.

129
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,160
I just want to let you know

130
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,599
that Ji Yuheng from Dairui

131
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,200
is actually my

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,280
soon-to-be husband.

133
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,400
Our relationship

134
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,760
has always been hard to make public.

135
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm

136
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,520
not trying to

137
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,559
threaten you.

138
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,160
I just want to help Yuheng.

139
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,280
Get in the car.

140
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:29,880
Thank you.

141
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,239
What happened to you?

142
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,400
It's none of your business.

143
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,280
Are you trying to

144
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,559
make a mess out of yourself

145
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:47,720
to elicit sympathy from Yuheng?

146
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,359
Move aside.

147
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,080
You're soaking wet!

148
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,960
What if you catch a cold?

149
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
I need to talk to you.

150
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,679
You don't need to go to the US anymore.

151
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,960
Mr. Xia is in China.

152
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,400
I've met someone

153
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,160
who has agreed to help arrange

154
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,880
a meeting tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

155
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,039
Are you serious?

156
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,080
- Tang Yuhui...
- Tang Yuhui.

157
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,359
What's wrong with you?

158
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,400
For the result,

159
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,599
you'll see tomorrow, right?

160
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,439
Why do you

161
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,799
always look down on others?

162
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,080
Fine.

163
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,559
I'll assume you've made it.

164
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,679
But I could have

165
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:18,439
settled this with one word.

166
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,599
Look at you now,

167
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,599
soaked like this.

168
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,479
You've gone through a lot, huh?

169
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,479
If

170
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,280
it's true,

171
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,679
why didn't you do it sooner?

172
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,799
You know my secret,

173
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,679
then are you trying

174
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,720
to threaten me?

175
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,679
I won't let you

176
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,080
use it against me!

177
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,840
Do you feel better now?

178
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,880
Much better.

179
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:57,840
Here,

180
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,119
try it and see if it's hot.

181
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:02,520
It's hot.

182
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,280
As your supervisor,

183
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,960
I appreciate your help.

184
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,239
But as your family,

185
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,799
I hope in the future,

186
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,599
you won't make such rash decisions

187
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,720
without consulting me.

188
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,119
I'm really worried.

189
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,119
As a subordinate,

190
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,479
I think sales

191
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,679
is inherently a tough job.

192
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,400
So I hope

193
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,559
we can boost our performance.

194
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,119
As your family,

195
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,520
I genuinely worry about you.

196
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,320
I want to do everything I can

197
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,119
to support you.

198
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,439
Besides,

199
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,599
who knows you've actually

200
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,840
got a plan B.

201
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,280
So it sounds like

202
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,960
you don't have faith in me.

203
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,239
That's not true.

204
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,839
Man,

205
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,000
I feel awful.

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I might be coming down with a cold.

207
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:51,799
A bad one.

208
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,719
And here I'm being

209
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,199
lectured by my husband.

210
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,160
Bah!

211
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,400
Don't say that.

212
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,079
Didn't we agree not to

213
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
discuss work at home?

214
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,600
No nagging, okay?

215
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,400
I need to tell you something

216
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
very serious.

217
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,120
That Tang Yuhui,

218
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,079
she knows

219
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,439
about our relationship.

220
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,760
She has feelings for you.

221
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,520
Everyone seems to know.

222
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,520
Since she's aware of this,

223
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,919
won't she be eager

224
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,160
to spill the beans?

225
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,079
So she could

226
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:34,360
have me pack my stuff and leave.

227
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,280
How can you be so sure

228
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,839
that you'll leave?

229
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,480
We signed an earnout agreement.

230
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,760
We have to stick to it.

231
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
Although I'm not sure

232
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,959
what you progress is.

233
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,600
However, I still haven't

234
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,160
met my KPI

235
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,079
of fifty million.

236
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:51,480
If it gets exposed now,

237
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,799
I'll definitely be the one to go.

238
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't sweat it.

239
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
In the banking industry,

240
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,480
there are three types of people.

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,600
Relying on

242
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,280
their own skills,

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,559
or on

244
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
family connections,

245
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,400
or

246
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,039
on both.

247
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,600
Tang Yuhui

248
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,360
is exactly the third type.

249
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:16,679
Such individuals

250
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,919
grow up in this environment.

251
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,319
They're good

252
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,319
at assessing situations.

253
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:21,679
They also tend to have

254
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,559
a bit of arrogance.

255
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,959
So whatever they choose to do

256
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:25,640
needs to be in their best interest.

257
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,799
Think about it.

258
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,120
Why didn't she expose us

259
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,439
in the first place?

260
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,360
She must feel

261
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,120
that this situation

262
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,520
is not beneficial to her at all.

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,760
Well,

264
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,000
I hope so.

265
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,520
It's okay.

266
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:47,959
Ginger soup can warm you up.

267
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,120
So you should finish it up.

268
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,199
[I can leave Dairui]

269
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,199
[just to be with him.]

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,760
[What about you?]

271
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,679
[If that day ever comes,]

272
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,480
[what choice will]

273
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,199
[Ji Yuheng and I make?]

274
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,719
Just a moment, please.

275
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,520
Mingrui is still in a meeting.

276
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,360
His schedule is packed

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,559
these days before going abroad.

278
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,039
We are supposed to be dating

279
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,480
for the next two hours.

280
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,199
Thank you, Ms. Geng.

281
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I really appreciate it.

282
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,799
[Hello, Mr. Xia.]

283
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,039
Who are they?

284
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,959
This is Xiaoning,

285
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,439
[a new friend I just met.]

286
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,079
[This is Mr. Ji,]

287
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,079
[her fiancé.]

288
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,480
It's a pleasure.

289
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:56,919
I'm Ji Yuheng

290
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,400
from Dairui.

291
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,039
Nice to meet you.

292
00:11:58,319 --> 00:11:58,799
You too.

293
00:11:59,319 --> 00:11:59,760
Nice to meet you.

294
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,199
Tu Xiaoning, an account manager from Dairui.

295
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,079
Nice to meet you.

296
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,959
It's not easy

297
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,240
to carve out time for a date.

298
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,760
Why has it suddenly

299
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,839
turned into work again?

300
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,839
Our date can wait.

301
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,160
Once the deal of your resort

302
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,719
is settled,

303
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,919
you could spend quality time with me.

304
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,160
By the way,

305
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,079
I heard that

306
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,439
there's a treasure in this city,

307
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,199
the Nanshan Mountain.

308
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,240
The temple in there is quite popular.

309
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,679
I've always wanted to check it out,

310
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,120
but I haven't found a good guide yet.

311
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,400
[Xiaoning,]

312
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,439
[since you're a local,]

313
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,919
[would you be willing to show me around?]

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,679
My pleasure.

315
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,559
We will leave you guys to it.

316
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,520
Let's go.

317
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,319
Have a seat.

318
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:48,880
Mr. Ji,

319
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,160
I remember your proposal.

320
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,360
Having Professor Jia Ziqing

321
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,240
serve as a financial advisor,

322
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,280
you really impressed me.

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,520
[This is]

324
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,839
[a souvenir from our press conference.]

325
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,120
[It features the famous zodiac signs,]

326
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,559
[for a kid's first birthday celebrations.]

327
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,799
[I'll take this one.]

328
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:45,600
[OK.]

329
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:51,919
Ms. Geng,

330
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,120
thank you so much!

331
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:54,280
No problem.

332
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,039
This is the first time I've met your fiancé.

333
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
He's indeed outstanding.

334
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,160
You're

335
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,079
secretly married because of work,

336
00:13:59,079 --> 00:13:59,919
right?

337
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,919
Yeah.

338
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,000
You even had to fight for

339
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,360
the chance to see Mingrui,

340
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,480
and that's why

341
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,919
you revealed your relationship.

342
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,439
I completely

343
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
understand where you're coming from.

344
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,240
Love is the hardest thing to conceal.

345
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,959
Yet,

346
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:17,600
happiness cannot be shared,

347
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,640
and pain cannot be expressed.

348
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,679
So I'm willing to lend a hand.

349
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,600
Also a way to gather blessings for myself.

350
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,039
Thank you for your understanding.

351
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,319
I also believe that what you seek

352
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,039
will surely be answered.

353
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,400
Let's go.

354
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,480
When it comes to a large company

355
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,199
like Weiji,

356
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:52,919
I believe

357
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,240
that all banks

358
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,880
are willing to provide

359
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,319
the best solutions

360
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:57,000
in terms of loan terms, amount,

361
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:57,839
and interest rates.

362
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,039
As for Xingcheng,

363
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,280
as a pilot for Weiji Resort

364
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,919
to expand into second-tier cities,

365
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,199
it has different consumer demands

366
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,760
compared to first-tier cities.

367
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,559
Therefore, financial service plans

368
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,600
also need to align with

369
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,880
local market demands

370
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,520
and customer structure.

371
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,120
This makes it difficult to simply

372
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,559
replicate and duplicate past experiences.

373
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,480
But you can rest assured.

374
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,679
We at Dairui

375
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,360
will fully cooperate with Professor Jia

376
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,319
to start from

377
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:19,799
your economic needs

378
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,240
to optimize financing solutions

379
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,839
that align with the economic

380
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,559
characteristics of second-tier cities.

381
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,559
You've made yourself

382
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,520
crystal clear.

383
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,280
I'll have my assistant

384
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,079
reach out to you for the details.

385
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:34,480
So,

386
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,959
are you saying...

387
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:37,760
The structure and details

388
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,679
you're saying

389
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,319
are much clearer than those in the files.

390
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,439
Let's work towards a strategic alignment.

391
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:54,799
Alright,

392
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,559
sounds good.

393
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,400
So,

394
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,880
on behalf of Dairui,

395
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,240
I want to express my gratitude

396
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:01,959
for your support and trust.

397
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:03,039
As rumored,

398
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,559
you're quite aware

399
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,240
of

400
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,280
the importance of time,

401
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,079
not wasting too much on comparisons.

402
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,360
Excessive comparison is pointless.

403
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,559
What I choose

404
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,199
will undoubtedly be the best option.

405
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,039
Let's head out now.

406
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,559
Before the

407
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,319
next meeting,

408
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,360
we can still meet up with our wives.

409
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:22,880
Would you like to tag along?

410
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,199
Absolutely.

411
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,039
Let's go.

412
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:31,959
You have played a crucial role

413
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:32,959
in securing

414
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,400
the Weiji project.

415
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,600
Tell me,

416
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,799
as soon as the news was out,

417
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,199
many already came to recruit you, right?

418
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,240
Sir, a supervisor

419
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,039
from the headquarters came for a meeting

420
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,039
and suddenly requested to see me.

421
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,600
Is it also because of the deal with Weiji?

422
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,600
Yes, it is.

423
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,039
Please come in.

424
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,520
Hello, President Xu.

425
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,079
Mr. Zhou.

426
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,760
It's been a while.

427
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,480
Indeed.

428
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,079
Let me introduce.

429
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,039
This is

430
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,199
Ji Yuheng, the manager of S1.

431
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,880
He's the key player in securing

432
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,600
the Weiji case.

433
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,679
A pleasure, sir.

434
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,280
Young and talented!

435
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,039
Your future is promising.

436
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,919
Thank you.

437
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:12,919
If it weren't for

438
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,360
my team's collective efforts,

439
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,079
I might not have

440
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,039
secured this opportunity.

441
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,520
I've also

442
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,400
heard about it.

443
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,839
What's the name of that rookie?

444
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,439
Her name is Tu...

445
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:23,319
Tu Xiaoning.

446
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,600
Mr Li,

447
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,840
here's the receipt for this transaction.

448
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,679
I came for business nearby.

449
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,519
I heard you're here,

450
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,600
so I brought it over for you.

451
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,439
Thank you.

452
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:36,719
What would you like to drink?

453
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:37,759
Tell me.

454
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,279
No, thank you.

455
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,880
It's working hours.

456
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,640
Not a good time.

457
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:41,800
Let's save it for next time.

458
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,880
On my day off,

459
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:43,560
I'll visit you

460
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,519
with my dad.

461
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,199
That sounds good.

462
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:47,439
Your team

463
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,560
secured the Weiji project,

464
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,160
and in less than half an afternoon,

465
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,600
the news spread throughout the industry.

466
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,160
You've really made a splash this time.

467
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,439
Just be honest with me,

468
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,600
was it your dad

469
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,519
that hooked it up for you?

470
00:17:58,919 --> 00:17:59,800
No, not my dad.

471
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,479
Mr. Ji from our team

472
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,080
found the contact information

473
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,759
through his own connections.

474
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,199
Ji Yuheng.

475
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,279
Your senior from college, right?

476
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,400
Your university

477
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,640
really produces outstanding talent!

478
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,279
About what I mentioned last time,

479
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,800
you should give it some thought.

480
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,320
You know, I've been

481
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,479
close with your dad for years.

482
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,320
Just come to Shunjue and work for me.

483
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,679
I will offer you the best package.

484
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,439
Salary, benefits,

485
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,400
you name it.

486
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,919
Um,

487
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,600
how about

488
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,400
giving me more time?

489
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:31,439
I'll think it over.

490
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,479
You said it, alright?

491
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:33,999
You can't give me

492
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:34,679
the runaround again.

493
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,080
Rest assured,

494
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,800
this time I will

495
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,959
definitely give it serious thought.

496
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,439
Good, good.

497
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,040
Get up, it's time for work.

498
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,400
Was this one taken in Xihai Town?

499
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,880
Isn't it beautiful?

500
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,160
Who gave you permission to put this here?

501
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,840
There are portrait rights involved.

502
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,519
I can display my own girlfriend,

503
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:45,640
can't I?

504
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,640
What?

505
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,080
When did I agree

506
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,959
to be your girlfriend?

507
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:53,600
No backing out from this.

508
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,279
What are you laughing about?

509
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,400
No backing out, no backing out!

510
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,600
Once you move in,

511
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,640
I'll convert this desk

512
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:04,840
into a dresser

513
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,919
for you.

514
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,199
Then you can do

515
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,439
your makeup here

516
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,719
every morning.

517
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,759
What about you?

518
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,279
You'll be

519
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,040
by my side,

520
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,759
having some

521
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,160
dirty thoughts about me?

522
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,239
Am I not allowed?

523
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,199
Huh?

524
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,279
How far is your home from the company?

525
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,040
Forty minutes drive.

526
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,120
We've got half an hour until clock-in.

527
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,160
What's that phone of yours for?

528
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,999
Just for show?

529
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,199
It doesn't even have an alarm!

530
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,759
Who unplugged my charging cable

531
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,479
last night and

532
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,719
plugged in their own?

533
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,199
Now my phone is dead.

534
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,719
Am I supposed to rely on willpower to get up?

535
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,320
It's going to be a vibrant day!

536
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,199
Good morning, Jing!

537
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,800
Morning, Jing.

538
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,560
Morning, Jing.

539
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:49,120
Good morning.

540
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,199
Good morning, Fanggang.

541
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:54,919
Morning.

542
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,519
What?

543
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:04,040
Sneaking around

544
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,759
early in the morning,

545
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,600
that was spooky!

546
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,640
Fanggang,

547
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,120
you're late.

548
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,239
Are you giving up on your precious?

549
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I mean, attendance bonus.

550
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,160
I had

551
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,919
some issues at home this morning,

552
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,479
which caused the delay.

553
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:19,400
You've been acting strange lately.

554
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,400
Last week, you refused to work overtime

555
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:23,640
for three times your salary

556
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
because of family matters.

557
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:25,439
That's not like you.

558
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
You guys...

559
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,239
When I was ambitious before,

560
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:32,880
I worked overtime every day.

561
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
When you invited me out for drinks,

562
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,120
I didn't go, and you said I didn't care.

563
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,360
So now I'm

564
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,120
indifferent to fame and fortune,

565
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,279
leaving opportunities to you all.

566
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,040
Here you go again, questioning me.

567
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,600
You may be indifferent to those,

568
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,719
but in other aspects,

569
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:45,560
you must get more intense, right?

570
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,679
[Family issues?]

571
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,199
They must

572
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,840
not be trivial.

573
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:52,959
[It's a big deal.]

574
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,400
Are you dating?

575
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,800
I guessed it right, huh?

576
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,519
He has a girlfriend now!

577
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,959
C'mon.

578
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,479
You're being too distant!

579
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,239
Such a big news,

580
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,840
and you didn't even share with us.

581
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,719
When will you bring her

582
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,479
to meet us?

583
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:15,800
I...

584
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,360
I've been busy

585
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,279
with the Weiji contract

586
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:18,959
these days.

587
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:19,880
How about

588
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,719
I treat you all

589
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:21,840
to a meal sometime later?

590
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,719
Are you serious?

591
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,160
Look!

592
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,560
Our

593
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,160
partnership with Weiji

594
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,719
seems to be finalized.

595
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:39,719
That watch

596
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,679
Mr. Xia is wearing

597
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,679
is pretty expensive.

598
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,320
When did you start analyzing watches?

599
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,600
Did you get a new one?

600
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,600
Nice!

601
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,160
Look at our boss.

602
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,479
[He's been wearing]

603
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,439
[the same old model for ages.]

604
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,999
[Low-key!]

605
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,880
[Yeah.]

606
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,040
Is everyone here?

607
00:22:58,959 --> 00:22:59,439
I've got

608
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,400
an announcement to make.

609
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:04,040
Um, Yuhui is meeting a client.

610
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:05,519
Pass it on to her later.

611
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,080
Sure.

612
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:07,800
The contract with Weiji

613
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,040
has been officially secured.

614
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,560
Thanks for

615
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,600
all your hard work,

616
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,600
especially you, Xiaoning.

617
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,160
[Well, Jing,]

618
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,919
your trainee seems

619
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,239
to surpass you.

620
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,679
I mean, braver than you.

621
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,199
I'm happy to see it.

622
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
One more.

623
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
I'm excited to say

624
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,999
that Mr. Xia invited us

625
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,120
[to tour one of]

626
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,560
[his operating resort projects]

627
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,239
[next week.]

628
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,120
It's been a while

629
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,199
since our dept had an outing.

630
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,560
We're allowed for

631
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,679
paid leave for this trip.

632
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,400
Time to relax!

633
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,519
Fantastic!

634
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,519
A trip, finally!

635
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:47,320
Time for drinks!

636
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,560
All right, back to work.

637
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:52,479
Move it.

638
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,120
About that friend of his...

639
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,040
Enough, enough.

640
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,239
Ms. Rao,

641
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,360
I have a client

642
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,320
who keeps mentioning

643
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,600
something about your side...

644
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,759
Come here.

645
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:19,640
When did you buy this?

646
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,959
Before I came up.

647
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,600
How is it,

648
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,640
any issues?

649
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:24,800
Nope.

650
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:25,439
Great.

651
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,719
Have a taste.

652
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,959
Get lost.

653
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,320
[Got time after work?]

654
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:47,759
[Let's go shopping.]

655
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,080
Are you seriously buying a watch?

656
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,999
You used to stash

657
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:09,400
every penny in high-yield

658
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,919
savings account,

659
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,120
but suddenly is splurging?

660
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,320
I wonder

661
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,239
what kind of luck Ji Yuheng had

662
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,560
in his past life.

663
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,439
Keep it low-key.

664
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,080
Facing so many social engagements,

665
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,519
he should have a decent watch.

666
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,800
I've managed our money so long,

667
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,479
but never thought

668
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,959
about getting him a gift.

669
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:26,759
Now that

670
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,239
he's sealed the deal with Weiji,

671
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,120
it's a perfect excuse to celebrate.

672
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:32,999
A luxury watch?

673
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,239
Aren't you being extravagant?

674
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,560
It's worth it!

675
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,080
Securing Weiji

676
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,719
means

677
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,080
he's more likely

678
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:41,840
to move up to the Ji'an branch.

679
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,800
This watch

680
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,479
is my way

681
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,840
of preemptively celebrating.

682
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,679
Besides,

683
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,679
my birthday's coming up.

684
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:49,959
He's definitely getting me something,

685
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,199
then

686
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,239
I can whip out this watch

687
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,600
as a return gift.

688
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,040
He'll be over the moon.

689
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,239
The key is

690
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:58,120
to keep him under control.

691
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,479
Alright.

692
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,759
You're more liberal than I'm now.

693
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,040
I've been under constant attack

694
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,479
by all these hidden expenses.

695
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,840
Assassins rise from

696
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,160
everywhere, you know,

697
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:11,040
supermarkets, ice cream,

698
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,719
duck neck,

699
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,519
even power bank!

700
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,600
Ever since I had that

701
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,239
money argument with Qi Yu,

702
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,239
I've been trying

703
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,080
to survive on my

704
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
salary alone.

705
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,600
But

706
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,560
my 3,000 yuan paycheck

707
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,600
vanishes

708
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
like sand

709
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,800
on a beach.

710
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,400
The power of love

711
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,560
is truly amazing.

712
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,320
It can even change your views on money.

713
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,560
How about giving the high-yield

714
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,800
savings account another thought?

715
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,479
Stop teasing me.

716
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:38,880
I'm not even

717
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,679
using my dad's card anymore.

718
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:41,759
Now,

719
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,800
surviving on

720
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,040
my salary is a struggle,

721
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,279
let alone saving anything.

722
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,160
When you're back on your feet,

723
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,519
I'll help you with some investments.

724
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,759
Hope that day

725
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,679
comes soon.

726
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:58,800
What are you looking at?

727
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,560
Nothing, nothing.

728
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,199
Don't be mad.

729
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,600
You go get a divorce or I'll go!

730
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,120
They look really familiar.

731
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,439
That guy is...

732
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,640
Oh, no!

733
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,919
I'll buy you

734
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,040
a bag later.

735
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
The latest model,

736
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,600
OK?

737
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,759
Shopping and stumbling upon

738
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,040
such a juicy bit of gossip,

739
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,560
unbelievable.

740
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,919
You can indulge in any gossip.

741
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:21,679
Stop looking.

742
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,880
Don't look.

743
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,199
After we buy the watch,

744
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:25,040
I'll treat you to something good.

745
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,719
Really?

746
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,719
I'm gonna order something expensive.

747
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,360
You know,

748
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,560
I've been downgraded

749
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,479
in everything lately,

750
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,360
just to stick to the principle of

751
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,640
spending within the earned money.

752
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,199
I'll upgrade it for you later.

753
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:39,320
Come on.

754
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:39,919
Let's go.

755
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,679
This is your first birthday

756
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,759
after we get married.

757
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,199
We can't celebrate it alone.

758
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,919
But a gift is still a must.

759
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,880
What have you prepared for me?

760
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,239
It's a secret.

761
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,959
A secret, huh?

762
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,600
Do you think

763
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,439
our colleagues

764
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,519
know it's my birthday?

765
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:01,519
Maybe

766
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,759
they're planning a surprise?

767
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:03,999
How would I know?

768
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,279
You, Zhao Fanggang, and Rao Jing

769
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,840
are always plotting something

770
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
in the group of yours.

771
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,640
Will you tell me,

772
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,519
your boss?

773
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,919
How do you know

969
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,560
Exactly.

970
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:49,440
Those who

971
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,879
owe money are the real bosses.

972
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,839
The other day,

973
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:54,199
I made dozens of polite calls.

974
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,759
A boss just said,

975
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:56,359
"Isn't it

976
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,839
a bit of interest

977
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:57,839
I owe? What are you

978
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:58,560
in a hurry for?"

979
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,319
You don't say.

980
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,279
Then he hung up

981
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:01,000
and still didn't pay.

982
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:01,640
[Yeah,]

983
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,239
[they wait until the central bank]

984
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,199
[shuts down the system,]

985
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,440
then transfer a hundred thousand

986
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
in 5,0000 yuan increments,

987
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,799
making it a hassle for everyone.

988
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,799
They take this work seriously.

989
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,040
Talking about work on a holiday.

990
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:13,279
And when they

991
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,279
need money,

992
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,359
they call you like crazy,

993
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,040
not letting you sleep,

994
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:16,920
keeping an eye on you 24/7

995
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,960
until you release the funds.

996
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,440
That

997
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,120
reminds me.

998
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,000
Once,

999
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,000
a female accountant

1000
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:23,879
[pulled up a chair right behind me,]

1001
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,160
[staring at me]

1002
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:26,120
[like a security camera.]

1003
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,000
[I couldn't take it anymore,]

1004
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,759
[so I went to the restroom.]

1005
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,799
[Guess what she said?]

1006
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,560
["The loan hasn't been approved yet.]

1007
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,440
Where do you think you're going?"

1008
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,520
Yeah,

1009
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:35,399
it's so annoying.

1010
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,560
Unbearable.

1011
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,480
I'm going for another swim.

1012
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,480
Okay.

1013
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,319
Let's go.

1014
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,520
Let's go.

1015
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:45,440
Wait, my shoes...

1016
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,359
Test the water.

1017
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,480
[How's the water?]

1018
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,759
Mr. Zhao,

1019
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,279
when did you get cupping done?

1020
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,920
Feeling a bit under the weather lately?

1021
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:05,080
This rubber duck is cute.

1022
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,719
Yeah.

1023
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,679
Luckily, I dodged my period this time,

1024
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,480
or else

1025
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
it would've ruined the trip.

1026
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:10,279
Yeah,

1027
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,359
getting your period on a trip is the worst.

1028
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,199
What did you just say?

1029
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,199
I said I was lucky

1030
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:21,960
to avoid my period.

1031
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:31,000
Look,

1032
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,679
a duck.

1033
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,080
Rao Jing!

1034
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:34,640
Dear friends,

1035
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,000
today,

1036
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:37,799
we gather here

1037
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,560
not just for the team-building

1038
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,799
or the roast lamb.

1039
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:43,520
More importantly,

1040
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,879
we should celebrate

1041
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:46,279
the birthday of one

1042
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,399
of our colleagues.

1043
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,520
28 years ago,

1044
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,560
she came into this world.

1045
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
And now,

1046
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,759
she has become

1047
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:00,199
an outstanding member

1048
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,120
of our S1.

1049
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,239
Congrats!

1050
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,560
Tu Xiaoning!

1051
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,120
Thank you.

1052
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,679
[Come up]

1053
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,759
[and say something.]

1054
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,160
Thank you, Fanggang.

1055
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,040
[Thank you, everyone.]

1056
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,920
[Honestly, I had a feeling]

1057
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,239
[that you'll celebrate my birthday.]

1058
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,040
[But when it got close to midnight]

1059
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,440
and no one mentioned it,

1060
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,839
I thought you had forgotten.

1061
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,160
I'm really happy to have you

1062
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,359
by my side at work.

1063
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:37,359
I'd like to

1064
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,520
express my gratitude to you in turn.

1065
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,440
Since I joined the S1,

1066
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:41,279
I've received

1067
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:42,480
so much help from everyone.

1068
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,319
When I was feeling down,

1069
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,399
Jing

1070
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,480
always encouraged me.

1071
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,319
Fanggang has tried best

1072
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,359
to help me improve my performance.

1073
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:51,480
And

1074
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,600
two Miss Yao,

1075
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:53,879
Xu Li,

1076
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:55,080
and Li Xiang

1077
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,440
were always

1078
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:57,560
the first to help me

1079
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,640
whenever I faced trouble.

1080
00:38:58,879 --> 00:38:59,679
I'm grateful to all of you.

1081
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,399
I also wanna thank my old colleague,

1082
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,239
Yuhui.

1083
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,319
Her presence

1084
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:07,799
reminds me to work harder

1085
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,120
and keep going.

1086
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,640
Lastly, thanks a million,

1087
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,679
Mr. Ji.

1088
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,719
He has always encouraged

1089
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,359
and trusted me,

1090
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,000
helping me grow

1091
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
from someone knowing

1092
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,960
nothing about sales

1093
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,839
into someone

1094
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:37,759
who can now

1095
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,000
handle things on her own.

1096
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,719
I really enjoy this feeling

1097
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,560
of fighting alongside you all.

1098
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:54,560
Thank you

1099
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,000
all.

1100
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,120
I much appreciate it.

1101
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:08,839
Cool!

1102
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,239
Let's say

1103
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,120
happy birthday

1104
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:12,040
to

1105
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:13,000
Xiaoning!

1106
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,399
Happy birthday!

1107
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,160
Happy birthday!

1108
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Happy birthday!

1109
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:18,279
Thanks.

1110
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:18,799
Happy birthday!

1111
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,399
Thank you.

1112
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,440
Let me add some more for you,

1113
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:40,879
Ms. Rao.

1114
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:41,719
No, thanks.

1115
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,520
Been waiting so long.

1116
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,160
[Can't wait to dig in.]

1117
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:48,319
[I don't eat this.]

1118
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:51,839
[Go ahead.]

1119
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,679
Excuse me.

1120
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,160
Today is Xiaoning's birthday.

1121
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,480
I wanna take this chance

1122
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:04,000
to announce something.

1123
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:09,440
[Is she about]

1124
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,080
[to reveal]

1125
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,399
[my relationship with Ji Yuheng?]

1126
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,399
I'm going to say it out

1127
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,000
through a song.

1128
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:29,719
A song?

1129
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:30,239
Good!

1130
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:31,239
[Cool!]

1131
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,359
[She's talented, huh?]

1132
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,600
[She can sing.]

1133
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,520
[I didn't expect this.]

1134
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
