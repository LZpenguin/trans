English subtitles are available

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,160
You Are My Secret EP01

3
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,870
Good morning there.

4
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,950
May I

5
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,950
have your name please?

6
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,160
Good morning.

7
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm Tu Xiaoning.

8
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,950
Miss Tu.

9
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,800
Nice to meet you.

10
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,360
Here.

11
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,920
Here's your Number Bear.

12
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,200
If you meet your Mr. Right,

13
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,030
you can exchange

14
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,310
the bears of yours

15
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,800
for

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
a bigger one.

17
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,960
Feel free to ask me

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,470
if you need help.

19
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,680
This way, please.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,240
At the age of 27,

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
I have two

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,120
big life events to accomplish.

23
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,120
This is one of them.

24
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,630
But when I get really into

25
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,960
the dating market,

26
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,350
reality slaps me in the face

27
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,120
over and over again.

28
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,520
Mismatch exists forever in the needs

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,470
between men and women here.

30
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
Good morning, Miss.

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,680
What's your number?

32
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,030
No. 36.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,870
This way, please.

34
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,350
My annual salary is in the eight figures.

35
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,030
I want my future partner

36
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,400
to be able and tough as me.

37
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,960
When we get married, we should

38
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,720
prepare for pregnancy as soon as possible.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,310
After all, you're 27 years old.

40
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,960
Right?

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Just six years younger than me.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,870
I thought

43
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,070
I'd have more possibilities

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,870
with incessant bind dates.

45
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,070
Sir.

46
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,840
Here's your Number Bear.

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,790
If you meet your Ms. Right,

48
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,680
you can exchange

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,630
the bears of yours

50
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,470
for

51
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,520
this big bear.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,960
Just keep it up.

53
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,030
I'll try my luck on evening session.

54
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,790
Hello.

55
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,590
Hello.

56
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,350
Let me introduce myself.

57
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,400
I work at a bank.

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,790
I just returned from abroad a while ago.

59
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,960
I'm still struggling

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,070
to fit in.

61
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,750
I was abroad

62
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,070
for my study, too.

63
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,670
But

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
I've been back for over three years.

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,990
Now I'm working for a state-owned company.

66
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,840
If you need

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,080
any help,

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,990
you can call me.

69
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,320
What a good match.

70
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,550
You work

71
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,790
in a bank?

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,990
So, you studied financial management?

73
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,550
My undergraduate degree is

74
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,080
in business management in China.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,640
I went to graduate school abroad

76
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,880
for finance.

77
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,840
I went to graduate school

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,990
for business management, too.

79
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,200
What a coincidence.

80
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,030
What do you think of me?

81
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,110
This pair should be a done deal.

82
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,200
Sorry.

83
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,990
I need to reconsider.

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,200
Reconsider?

85
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,550
Can't find a match, even for good ones, huh?

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,230
I think we can get to know

87
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,160
each other a little better.

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,640
What am I waiting for?

89
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,230
Long time no see.

90
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,280
Tu Xiaoning.

91
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,160
Ji,

92
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,880
Ji Yuheng?

93
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,280
At this moment I do not know,

94
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,990
the parallel lines

95
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,110
that seemingly have no intersection

96
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,030
are about to curve.

97
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,880
Here.

98
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,230
Thank you.

99
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,160
Thank you.

100
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,430
It has been years.

101
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,760
Where are you working at now?

102
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,840
Internal Controls and Compliance Department.

103
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,080
Bank of Dairui Head Office.

104
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,670
Such a coincidence.

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,990
You're at Dairui, too?

106
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,400
The Internal Controls and Compliance Department.

107
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,760
It's responsible for auditing,

108
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,910
supervising,

109
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,590
and anti-money laundering

110
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,910
within the bank.

111
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,030
Exactly.

112
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,030
If I fall into

113
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,080
your hands,

114
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:32,960
please

115
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,160
have mercy on me.

116
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,430
I don't know.

117
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,840
I might be stricter to you.

118
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,350
Then, I

119
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,550
have to be

120
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,760
on my toes.

121
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,670
It's been a long time.

122
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,520
How about

123
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,590
we exchange WeChat number?

124
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:53,990
What do you say?

125
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,840
Sure.

126
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,160
I'll scan your QR Code.

127
00:07:59,470 --> 00:07:59,760
Okay.

128
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Do we have to be so even?

129
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
It's a rule of blind dating.

130
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,350
Splitting the bill.

131
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,230
I'm comfortable with that.

132
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,350
If we have a chance to meet again,

133
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,280
as an old classmate,

134
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,990
I can buy you the meal.

135
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,670
If that's the case,

136
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,550
I seem to have failed this time.

137
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,960
Not completely.

138
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,280
We got the big bear.

139
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,840
It's just

140
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,670
half failure.

141
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,080
Weiyi.

142
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,590
What's up?

143
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,590
How was it?

144
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,790
I haven't heard from you all afternoon.

145
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,280
Nothing.

146
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,080
Aren't there hundreds of people

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,990
at the dating rally?

148
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
You haven't found even one of

149
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,590
those fish?

150
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,160
No.

151
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,160
I should've gone with you.

152
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,030
I can't believe

153
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,000
there's not even one

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
suitable man out there.

155
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,160
Well, not exactly.

156
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
There is one.

157
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,160
But

158
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,400
he's a special case,

159
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,240
so he can be ignored.

160
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,160
"Special"?

161
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,280
What kind of "special"?

162
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,950
I'll tell you later.

163
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,950
Better go now.

164
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,240
Oh my God!

165
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,550
It's so embarrassing!

166
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,160
It's already too much to meet a high school

167
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,910
classmate on a blind date.

168
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,310
Now I have to count on his car

169
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
to take my scooter!

170
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,640
I must have been out of my mind

171
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,710
when I said yes.

172
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't think this scooter

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,190
can get you back.

174
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,760
How about I drive you home?

175
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,030
So,

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,760
is this the safe place

177
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,830
to put a scooter?

178
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,600
Ji Yuheng.

179
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,480
Why don't you

180
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,520
put me,

181
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,430
no,

182
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,280
put both

183
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,310
of us

184
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,240
here.

185
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
I can go back by myself.

186
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,120
It's alright.

187
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,710
I can drive you back.

188
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,190
The fish you are saying

189
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,310
is your old classmate

190
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,190
you met in blind date?

191
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,280
Then what are you waiting for?

192
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,760
It's time to show

193
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,120
your real skills.

194
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,910
Take him!

195
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,520
Do you

196
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,880
want to take me?

197
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,880
It's just that your scooter

198
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,070
got busted.

199
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,760
Take it easy.

200
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,240
It wasn't my scooter got busted.

201
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,790
It was my dignity.

202
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,710
It wasn't my scooter squealed,

203
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,790
but the heart

204
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,070
inside me.

205
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,360
Don't be so dramatic.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,670
I'm telling you.

207
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,360
Such an elite

208
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
like him must have seen

209
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,030
countless top-notch women.

210
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,790
Just be yourself.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,830
Maybe that will make you

212
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,950
special enough to get his attention.

213
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,310
Forget it.

214
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,670
He and I are totally different.

215
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,790
Right.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,190
But I should warn you.

217
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,430
Your ex is coming back

218
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,710
from abroad next week.

219
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,430
You're about to meet

220
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,160
at a friend's pre-wedding party.

221
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,710
A Returnee student.

222
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,830
Doctor from private hospital.

223
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,030
Who said to make a handsome entrance

224
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,070
on the arm of a boyfriend

225
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,550
who is much taller

226
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,520
and three times better, and to slap with

227
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,360
her permanent employment contract

228
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,480
into his face?

229
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,160
Let me tell you, Xiaoning.

230
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,910
What's happening now is that

231
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,190
he's returning with academic excellence

232
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,000
and a bright future.

233
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,120
And you?

234
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,520
Love and career,

235
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,910
you have neither of them.

236
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,640
How are you going to catch up?

237
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,430
I have my career!

238
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,830
I can definitely be converted

239
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,790
to permanent.

240
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,830
What about a boyfriend?

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,360
Gotta go.

242
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,830
Come on!

243
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,950
Left, left, left!

244
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,400
Let me get a buff.

245
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,710
Why are you

246
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,670
stealing my kill?

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,360
Okay, that's enough!

248
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,670
You'd get me banned!

249
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,640
Look at other people's parents.

250
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,600
They're so anxious

251
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
about their kids

252
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,550
not having a date.

253
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,710
Can't you two learn something from them?

254
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,520
Introduce me to some boys!

255
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,240
"Some"?

256
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,070
Why don't you just kill me?

257
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,160
I can finally relief after retirement.

258
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,160
Now I still have to work for you?

259
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,160
I have squeezed clean

260
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,600
my square-dancing friends

261
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,910
for information of boys.

262
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,120
Now

263
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,520
all that's left is Mr. Wu's nephew,

264
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,950
who just returned from abroad.

265
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,240
Mr. Wu has a nephew?

266
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm telling you.

267
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,760
It's said that this young man

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,480
never went on a blind date.

269
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,030
He's got a good-looking face,

270
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,120
a clean family background,

271
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,550
good character

272
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,710
and ability.

273
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,550
If you can meet him,

274
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,400
I'm sure you'll never

275
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,030
want to go on another blind date.

276
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,910
Just one elite as him

277
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,480
is better than five ordinaries

278
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,430
in the dating market.

279
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,070
So,

280
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,070
have I

281
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,120
accomplished my KPIs

282
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,000
this month?

283
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,830
Don't push me

284
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,830
to introduce you boys again.

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,360
Give me his WeChat number.

286
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,950
Okay.

287
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm sending you his contact card.

288
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,070
On WeChat.

289
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,600
Okay, okay.

290
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,120
Let me see.

291
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,790
Mom.

292
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,030
If this boy is not

293
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,600
as good as you said,

294
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,550
he would not count

295
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,830
and you have to introduce me another.

296
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Ji Yuheng?

297
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,120
No way!

298
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,240
How can it be such a coincidence?

299
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,480
Mom, this...

300
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,430
Mom!

301
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,670
I can't handle this one.

302
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,670
Are there any other boys

303
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,480
I don't know?

304
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,710
I admit he's hot.

305
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,710
But I really can't get this one.

306
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,400
Thank you.

307
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,240
This blind date didn't work out,

308
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,360
but I'm about to

309
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,880
get my permanent employment contract.

310
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,000
Good morning.

311
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,160
Please get a number first.

312
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,550
Ms. Zhang, you're so early today.

313
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Ms. Li, yours is No. 10.

314
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,640
Please go there to receive your pension.

315
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,280
Mr. Wang.

316
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,160
I've calculated

317
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,000
your deposit rate.

318
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,480
Thank you.

319
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,600
Good morning.

320
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,790
How can I help you?

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,790
I want to make a deposit.

322
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,760
Please get a number here.

323
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,310
Okay.

324
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,190
Here you are.

325
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,760
Isn't today the VP meeting?

326
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,430
Why is Ji Yuheng here?

327
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,830
I don't know.

328
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,400
Please be seated.

329
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,000
Please.

330
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,710
Let's get started.

331
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,310
This is the quarterly

332
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,280
marketing statistics.

333
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,280
Foreign currency deposits

334
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,790
increased by $326 million year-on-year.

335
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,120
By the end of last month,

336
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,600
we have ￥25 million

337
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,830
in microenterprise loans

338
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,710
and non-performing loans,

339
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,190
a reduction of ￥10 million

340
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,070
from the same period last year.

341
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,600
Here's this quarterly

342
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,670
balance analysis

343
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,760
of Bank of Dairui.

344
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,910
I'd like to ask Deputy Manager Qi.

345
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,000
What is the cause for the ￥25 million

346
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,790
in non-performing loans?

347
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,670
These loans

348
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,160
are initially vetted

349
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,710
and rated as

350
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,360
low risk.

351
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,520
But in the end, the borrower

352
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,070
ran away because the business

353
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,910
went bankrupt

354
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,000
due to poor business practices.

355
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,790
We all know

356
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,950
these are unpredictable.

357
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,880
You said they were unpredictable.

358
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,710
Then let me ask you

359
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,600
a predictable one.

360
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,760
Show me the information

361
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,760
from this one's background check.

362
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,160
I thought today

363
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,880
was just a debriefing,

364
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,710
so I wasn't prepared.

365
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,310
I'll do it

366
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,910
right after...

367
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,550
"Not prepared"?

368
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,880
It's okay.

369
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,760
I've got it done for you.

370
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,190
I have a file with me.

371
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,830
Ji Yuheng!

372
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,790
At least we work together,

373
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,550
do you have to be so cruel?

374
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,710
Leaving me no choice?

375
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,190
I've already given you the chance.

376
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,070
Let's look at this.

377
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,280
Within these bad debts,

378
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,430
there are 10 small businesses

379
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,160
with loan balances in excess

380
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,310
of one million RMB.

381
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,230
There are a total of three

382
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,230
with ￥5 million loan balances.

383
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,120
Among these 13 businesses,

384
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,270
the actual controllers

385
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,430
include

386
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,560
but are not limited to,

387
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,600
your friends from college,

388
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,750
your distant relatives,

389
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,400
and even

390
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,750
your virtual clients.

391
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,190
How unpredictable.

392
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,360
We, as bank employees,

393
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,400
have been given the right to

394
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
mobilize huge amounts of money.

395
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,800
We should be using it for the good,

396
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,430
not to benefit ourselves.

397
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,190
You exceeded your KPIs?

398
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,880
Xiaoning,

399
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,910
You're going to kill yourself

400
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,880
and us!

401
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,160
What else can I do?

402
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,710
Performance is my backbone.

403
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
I must get permanent contract.

404
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,910
If I couldn't get it,

405
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,040
I wouldn't wait for another 3 years as an intern.

406
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,120
Xiaoning.

407
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,910
I glanced at the converting list

408
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,950
on the big boss's desk

409
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,880
when I was dropping off my report.

410
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,710
Your name is on it!

411
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,950
How are you going to celebrate?

412
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,080
You pick the restaurant.

413
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,230
It's been three years.

414
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,800
Finally, I can ask you for an extortionate dinner.

415
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
I'm calling you here

416
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,190
to announce

417
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,320
new permanent members this year

418
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,910
and transfers.

419
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,400
Without further ado,

420
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,600
here are the new

421
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,320
permanent members of Dairui

422
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,230
in the year of 2023.

423
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,840
Han Meijuan,

424
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,360
Zhao Xiaojun,

425
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,670
and Tang Yuhui.

426
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,800
Congratulations.

427
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,430
In addition, there's a staff shortage

428
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,910
in the Business Development Department.

429
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,990
The bank authorized

430
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,840
the secondment

431
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,640
from the lobby.

432
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,470
to supplement.

433
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,600
Tu Xiaoning.

434
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,910
From today on, you'll work at

435
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,670
Dept 1 of Business Development.

436
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,230
There are

437
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,270
better opportunities for you.

438
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,840
Good luck.

439
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,470
Here's

440
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,840
the highlights of

441
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,600
this afternoon's work.

442
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,230
Sir.

443
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,120
Why am I

444
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,600
not in the list?

445
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,080
Tu.

446
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,670
You've been working here for three years.

447
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,430
Why do you still ask

448
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,080
a question like that?

449
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:00,990
Just because

450
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,080
I've been here for three years,

451
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,080
I have to ask.

452
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,160
I am a contractor,

453
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,840
but I have credentials.

454
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,840
Speaking of reviews,

455
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,840
all my clients

456
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,670
give me 5 stars.

457
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,750
Speaking of my attendance,

458
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,600
I've never been

459
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,270
late for work or leave early

460
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,080
in three years.

461
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,190
Speaking of my performance,

462
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,400
I've been in the top three

463
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,470
on every assessment.

464
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,430
Tang Yuhui has

465
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,600
been here less than half a year,

466
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,320
and she's permanent now.

467
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,600
How

468
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,470
can I not be

469
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,080
in the list?

470
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,270
Good question.

471
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,910
Why not you?

472
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,470
Xiaoning.

473
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,560
You've been working here long.

474
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,670
Why can't you see

475
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,710
human network

476
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,670
is far more important than hard work?

477
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,710
Why is recruiting department called

478
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,880
"human resources"?

479
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,640
Because people

480
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,120
are a resource in themselves.

481
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,270
I keep wondering

482
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,400
why time flies

483
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,470
after the age of 25.

484
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,840
I've been trying so hard,

485
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,600
yet I still got nothing.

486
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,910
Maybe

487
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,080
I can keep telling myself

488
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,190
just to watch the road underfoot,

489
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,430
not the uncertain future.

490
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,320
But the consequence of taking

491
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,230
one step at a time

492
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,880
is to keep spiraling out of control

493
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,190
for the next three years.

494
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,080
I'm itching to do well in work and love.

495
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,670
Maybe it has nothing to do

496
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,190
with "I'm a contractor"

497
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,750
or "my ex's about to return".

498
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,080
It's just me

499
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,400
being insecure and anxious

500
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
at 27.

501
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,160
Mr. Zhong.

502
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,600
Tell him I'll be there this afternoon.

503
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,230
Okay.

504
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,640
Nice to meet you.

505
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,470
Are you

506
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,120
Tu Xiaoning?

507
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,510
I was  informed by the lobby

508
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,230
that you'll come.

509
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,950
Feel free to ask me

510
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,670
if you have questions.

511
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,710
They call me

512
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,600
"The Walking Encyclopedia" in BD Dept.

513
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,910
Oh,

514
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,040
I'm Zhou Kai.

515
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Don't mistake it

516
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,990
for "Zou Kai (go away)".

517
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,230
Nice to meet you.

518
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Just kidding.

519
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Relax.

520
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,320
Could I know who's in charge here?

521
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,710
Strictly speaking,

522
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,230
it's

523
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,160
good old Mr. Jiang.

524
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,600
But it's Jing

525
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,800
who has the final say.

526
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,470
Jing?

527
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,120
Yes.

528
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm sure you've heard of her.

529
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,400
The queen in

530
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,160
Dept. 1 of Business Development.

531
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,750
The infernal bomb of Dairui.

532
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,270
The last woman standing

533
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,470
in the bloodshed.

534
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
The most ambitious

535
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,560
iron lady.

536
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,840
She rules with atrocity during the day,

537
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,880
and sleep without a partner at night.

538
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,430
She's a woman

539
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,360
who probably going to

540
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,230
marry Mr. Money

541
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,040
for the rest of her life.

542
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,400
Isn't she?

543
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,880
Who?

544
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,640
Who's making up rumors?

545
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,670
Jing.

546
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,560
I'll help catch the rumor mongers now.

547
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,910
How's that medical loan going?

548
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,320
The guy in charge

549
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,120
-is being very evasive. -I don't want to hear

550
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
about your incompetence.

551
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
I want results, okay?

552
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,430
I'm fetching you results right now.

553
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,670
What is our bank's Late Repayment

554
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,160
Interest Rate?

555
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,710
It's 150%

556
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,510
of the normal rate.

557
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,600
Good.

558
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,270
Come with me.

559
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,510
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,600
I'm actually here to resign.

561
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,040
Whatever. Come in now.

562
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,160
Are you done?

563
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,470
Not yet.

564
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,400
Please wait.

565
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,640
Excuse me.

566
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,710
She's a fast worker.

567
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,120
How did you talk her out of leaving?

568
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,360
I didn't.

569
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,670
The member of our department

570
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,360
needs to do three times of work.

571
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,750
Compliance Department has its eye on us.

572
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,710
I can't waste

573
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,230
such free labor.

574
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,430
Better make good use of her.

575
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,510
You're completely

576
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,190
heartless.

577
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,670
"Heartless"?

578
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,120
I'm giving her a good lesson

579
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
before she leaves.

580
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,990
She's lucky.

581
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,750
You're still too young.

582
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,160
Subsection III

583
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,990
of article IV.

584
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,950
Good luck.

585
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,040
Jing.

586
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,600
Excuse me.

587
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,910
I've done the work

588
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,360
you asked me to do.

589
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:46,950
Where do I put them?

590
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,080
Here.

591
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,320
Do you have a moment now?

592
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,880
I need you to approve my separation request.

593
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,880
Separation request?

594
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,800
Don't you know non-staff personnel

595
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,510
don't have to

596
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,510
apply for separation?

597
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,710
No one told me that.

598
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,320
What's that look?

599
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,360
Are you feeling wronged?

600
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,120
You think the whole of Dairui

601
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,190
is rotten to the core,

602
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,880
and everyone's picking on you?

603
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,270
No.

604
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,560
I just think

605
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,160
it has to be fair.

606
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,270
Fair?

607
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,320
Fairness is for the courts,

608
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,560
not for the workplace.

609
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,190
Fifteen loan receipts.

610
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,990
You got two wrong.

611
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,670
Nine interest rate tables. You got one wrong.

612
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,190
When I started working here,

613
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,320
I woke up at 4:00 a.m. every day

614
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,160
to memorize policies, laws and regulations.

615
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,400
I thought I was working so hard.

616
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,430
But it's never enough.

617
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,750
There's always someone who works harder.

618
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,670
I don't have a good reputation

619
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,430
in this place.

620
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,400
But I'm in charge.

621
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,840
There's no paperwork

622
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,120
for your leaving or joining.

623
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,910
To complain and leave or to adapt.

624
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:47,880
It's up to you.

625
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,510
I'll

626
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,880
correct my mistakes first.

627
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,800
Here.

628
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,400
Hello, Fang Xiao.

629
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,710
Did you get the invitation to the party?

630
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,320
Yes.

631
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,080
Well,

632
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,400
I'm sure I'll be dressed

633
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,640
for your wedding,

634
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,750
but I'll pass the party

635
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,470
next weekend.

636
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,400
I have work to do.

637
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,190
What work?

638
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,910
Listen.

639
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,320
You haven't been

640
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,560
to college reunion yet.

641
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,190
So

642
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
you have to come this time.

643
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,430
Okay.

644
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,800
I'll go next weekend.

645
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:10,990
You'll see me.

646
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,320
Okay.

647
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,750
They say

648
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,710
the Business Development Department

649
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,600
is for those who's been frozen out.

650
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,190
Why did you agree to go?

651
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,230
I don't think so.

652
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,160
I think BD Dept.

653
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,910
is more promising

654
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,950
than the lobby.

655
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,560
It's just Dept. 1 is

656
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,880
not doing well recently.

657
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,400
I saw a lady today who was

658
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,430
particularly good.

659
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,400
I think I could learn

660
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,080
a lot from her.

661
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,470
Never give up.

662
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,230
That's the girl I know.

663
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,840
It isn't bad actually.

664
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,510
We can

665
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,640
continue to hang out in the same

666
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,670
building.

667
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,800
This one's good.

668
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,640
Not good enough for you.

669
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,120
Why don't you find me one

670
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,910
that suits me?

671
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,360
I'm working on it.

672
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,160
You're really going to go to that

673
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
pre-wedding party?

674
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,400
Of course.

675
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,800
The bride is my friend.

676
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,710
I have to go.

677
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,670
Besides,

678
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,560
I have to change

679
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,990
from always being passive.

680
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,320
No matter at work

681
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,950
or in love life,

682
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,510
I was likely to

683
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,950
take whatever they gave me.

684
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,600
So easy-going.

685
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,990
But when the results came in

686
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,120
which weren't what I expected,

687
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,360
I tended to be unhappy,

688
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,360
or even mad.

689
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,840
I can't go like this.

690
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,560
I'm going to start being proactive.

691
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,670
Having a voice in my life.

692
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,910
Okay.

693
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,320
Anyway, I'll support you

694
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,470
in whatever you decide.

695
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,910
But I've heard that

696
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,160
Lu Sijing can't get you

697
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,230
out of his mind when he's abroad.

698
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,430
He's trying to woo you again.

699
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,040
How about you?

700
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,040
Do you still love him?

701
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,950
Happy birthday to you.

702
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,840
Happy birthday to you.

703
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,950
Xiaoning.

704
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,990
Happy birthday.

705
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,080
I'm sorry.

706
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,990
I'd like to intern abroad

707
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,080
for one more year.

708
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,800
When you become a permanent

709
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,270
employee, I'll give you

710
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,360
an even bigger proposal.

711
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,270
Xiaoning.

712
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,990
Happy birthday!

713
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,600
Make a wish.

714
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,670
Lu Sijing.

715
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,190
You're missing out on

716
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,080
more than just a birthday proposal,

717
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,190
but our future.

718
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,880
Ending a seven-year relationship

719
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,640
was the best decision

720
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,800
I ever made.

721
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,600
How are you today?

722
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,430
Isn't it

723
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:39,990
romantic?

724
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,750
Ji Yuheng.

725
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,560
You're dressed so well.

726
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,080
Want to steal my spotlight?

727
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,840
No, handsome.

728
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,040
Happy wedding day.

729
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:57,880
Thanks.

730
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,360
The wedding is good.

731
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,040
Yeah, isn't it?

732
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,750
Fang Xiao.

733
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,470
Happy wedding day.

734
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,600
Just in time.

735
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,270
Let me introduce.

736
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,270
This is Ji Yuheng,

737
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,190
graduated from Qingbei University,

738
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,560
now working at Compliance Department

739
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,270
in Bank of Dairui Head Office.

740
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,470
This is Lu Sijing.

741
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,670
He just returned from aboard.

742
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,120
Doctor of Renji Hospital.

743
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,430
Nice to meet you.

744
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,160
We've met before.

745
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,640
Really?

746
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,950
Nice to meet you, too.

747
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,910
Why are you being so formal?

748
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,120
You are my friends

749
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,080
from different schools.

750
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,800
From now on,

751
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,040
you can be friends, too.

752
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,120
Remember

753
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,400
to invite me to dinner when you have time,

754
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,600
or I'll miss you so much.

755
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,560
Speaking of classmates,

756
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,750
I really missed you guys.

757
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,080
You did?

758
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,160
I can't tell.

759
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,320
After all, you didn't come to

760
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,670
our reunions all these years.

761
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,470
Today's second female lead.

762
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,080
She's not the same as she used to be.

763
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,670
She's prettier, isn't she?

764
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,360
It's something in her eyes.

765
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,120
I'm here

766
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,990
on a mission today.

767
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,560
You know

768
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,430
there's some misunderstanding

769
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,430
between me and Xiaoning.

770
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,120
So I'd like to use your place

771
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,320
to formally apologize to her.

772
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,990
I'm going to get her back.

773
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,230
Don't worry.

774
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:28,950
Just as

775
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,840
we planned.

776
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,560
I'm sure it's fine.

777
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,360
I'm going.

778
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,910
What's Lu Sijing up to?

779
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,640
Didn't they break up a long time ago?

780
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,080
What is this?

781
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,910
What is this?

782
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,320
Ji Yuheng?

783
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,710
What's he doing here?

784
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,160
Xiaoning.

785
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,160
Long time no see.

786
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,600
Long time no see.

787
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,430
What are you doing?

788
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,270
I'm here to apologize.

789
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,600
A year ago

790
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,990
on my birthday,

791
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,950
you said you'd propose to me

792
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,990
at my birthday party.

793
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,710
But you didn't.

794
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,430
You've already embarrassed me once.

795
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,360
What are you doing today?

796
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,190
You want to make it twice?

797
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,120
Xiaoning.

798
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,750
I know it's too late

799
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,440
for these,

800
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
but I have to tell you.

801
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,080
A year ago, as you were looking

802
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,750
forward to our marriage

803
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,920
and our future,

804
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,790
I was a deserter.

805
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,870
At that time I felt

806
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,270
getting married and starting a family then

807
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,870
was not the best choice.

808
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,750
It took me a year

809
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,750
to realize,

810
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,640
there's

811
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,230
no way

812
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,310
to put a value on love.

813
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,230
That's why I'm here,

814
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,710
in front of our friends,

815
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,960
to formally apologize to you.

816
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,230
Xiaoning.

817
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:16,920
I'm so sorry.

818
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,190
Please forgive me.

819
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,390
Forgive him!

820
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,830
Forgive him!

821
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,710
Forgive him!

822
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,520
Don't push her so hard!

823
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,310
It's her own choice.

824
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,710
Let her decide.

825
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,790
Yeah!

826
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,000
I still remember the day

827
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,870
he went back on his word.

828
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,190
How can she forgive him so easily?

829
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,000
Take the flowers back.

830
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,640
Right now.

831
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,440
Xiaoning.

832
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,160
I know you're still mad at me.

833
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Can you give me one more chance

834
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,120
to make it up to you?

835
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,640
You don't have to.

836
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,830
You don't owe me anything.

837
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,790
I really can't live without you.

838
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,040
You certainly can.

839
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,790
From the moment

840
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,230
you decided to leave

841
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,000
without a word,

842
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
you clearly knew it

843
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,350
that you'd be fine

844
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,040
without me.

845
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,790
It's over.

846
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,670
Take the flowers back.

847
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,640
I won't take them.

848
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,920
What are you doing?

849
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,000
He's still confessing.

850
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,000
Do you not like my flowers,

851
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,310
or do you not like me anymore?

852
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,790
What? What's going on?

853
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,480
What's going on?

854
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,790
Is Ji Yuheng

855
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,440
into Tu Xiaoning?

856
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,230
It's like

857
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,080
he's taking the heat off her.

858
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,000
Ji Yuheng, huh?

859
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,790
What do you want?

860
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,710
You said you like it,

861
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,830
so I bring it to you.

862
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,920
Isn't that our flower?

863
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,390
Silence.

864
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:55,960
It's pretty.

865
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,480
I like it.

866
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,440
What do you want?

867
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,270
This is something

868
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,040
between me and her.

869
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,480
It's got nothing to do with you.

870
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,040
Don't forget

871
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,600
it's a pre-wedding party

872
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,390
of our friend.

873
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,080
If it gets ugly,

874
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,830
it won't be "something between you".

875
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,960
I've got my flower.

876
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,350
I can't take yours.

877
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:30,870
Lu Sijing.

878
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,040
Don't think

879
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,710
I'm rejecting you today

880
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,790
because I'm angry with you.

881
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,040
I know what I want.

882
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,350
I just wish

883
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,270
I can see

884
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,670
a better version of myself

885
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,830
and a better life in the future.

886
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,960
It's a pre-wedding party of our friend.

887
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,600
We are grown-ups.

888
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,040
Don't make it ugly.

889
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,520
Okay.

890
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,640
Thank,

891
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,960
thank you.

892
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,190
Thank you for helping me out.

893
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,830
It's okay.

894
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,710
Looks like your last relationship

895
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,480
had a deep impact on you.

896
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:07,920
No.

897
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,190
I used to think that, too.

898
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,310
I thought I'd be angry

899
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,790
and hate him

900
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,670
when I saw him.

901
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,270
But actually, no.

902
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,270
I,

903
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,830
I used to wonder

904
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,870
if I'd still loved him.

905
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,870
But the moment

906
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:26,920
I asked myself

907
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,960
and I hesitated,

908
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,120
I knew I already had my answer.

909
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,670
Actually, I've always been

910
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,160
mad at him

911
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,960
for leaving

912
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,480
without a word.

913
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,520
And

914
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,560
I've always been mad at myself.

915
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,230
Sorry.

916
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,520
I talked too much.

917
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,600
So you go on blind dates

918
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,480
to get out of

919
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,230
the last relationship.

920
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,750
I go on blind dates because I want to

921
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,710
find blue chip stock

922
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,480
better than him

923
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,830
as quickly as possible.

924
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,040
Actually, I've figured it out.

925
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,830
I realize that

926
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,190
all I wanted is

927
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,870
a successful career,

928
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,000
a stable job,

929
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,870
a happy family,

930
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,040
and a visible future.

931
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,390
Do you have

932
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,160
any plans now?

933
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,670
Probably keep going on blind dates.

934
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,190
If,

935
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,560
I mean if.

936
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,040
If you just want

937
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,390
a stable marriage,

938
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,640
Will you,

939
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,480
I mean,

940
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,270
will you marry me?

941
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,120
Tu Xiaoning.

942
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,190
Time to go.

943
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,350
Okay.

944
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,270
Your turn,

945
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:16,310
Tu Xiaoning.

946
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,790
Good morning.

947
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,080
May I have your name please?

948
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,040
Good morning.

949
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,790
I'm Ji Yuheng.

950
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,560
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ji.

951
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,080
This is your Number Bear.

952
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,000
It's No. 35.

953
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,350
If you meet your Ms. Right,

954
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,040
you can exchange

955
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,520
the bears of yours

956
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,270
for

957
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,000
the bigger one.

958
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,000
This way, sir.

959
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,190
Thank you.
