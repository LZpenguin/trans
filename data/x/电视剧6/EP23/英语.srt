[English subtitles are available]

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:45,480
[You Are My Secret]
[EP23]

3
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,039
So, that's all for now.

4
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,360
These are Wutong Glass' new products

5
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,720
that I wanted to share with you.

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,039
Please stay tuned for more.

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,560
Thank you, Ms. Geng.

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,280
Please take a break

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
in the VIP room.

10
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,560
No, it's fine.

11
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:03,000
I need to go to the restroom to refine my make-up.

12
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,119
Alright, I'll go with you.

13
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm cool.

14
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,440
I can manage on my own.

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,160
Give me my purse.

16
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,479
OK, got it.

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,959
Please wrap this for her.

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,640
OK, thanks.

19
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:14,599
Hello.

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,560
How may I help you?

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,879
What's the meaning behind this one?

22
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:19,679
[This]

23
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:20,959
[is a souvenir from our press conference.]

24
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,319
[It features the famous zodiac signs.]

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,599
[It's for a kid's first birthday celebrations.]

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,000
[It's made of ultra-thin glass,]

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,280
[just one hundred microns thick.]

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,720
First birthday?

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,520
Good.

30
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,520
I'll take this one.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,400
OK.

32
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,160
It didn't go through.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,759
Let's try again.

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,240
OK.

35
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,400
Maybe your credit card...

36
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:45,799
Thank you.

37
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,759
Is there a problem?

38
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:47,960
It didn't get through.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,120
How could that happen?

40
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,079
Er...

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,680
Hello.

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm an account manager

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,079
from Dairui Bank.

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
Let me take a look at your card.

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,960
Thank you for your help.

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,000
No problem at all.

47
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:03,120
Your card has expired.

48
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,520
Typically, a credit card is valid for

49
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,479
three to five years.

50
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,560
You should reach out to your account manager

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
to help you apply for a new one.

52
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,720
Then just activate it,

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,440
and you'll be good to go.

54
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,000
But this one won't work.

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,280
Thank you.

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,400
So,

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,039
I'm sorry,

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,680
I can't make the purchase.

59
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,240
It's alright.

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,079
How about this?

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,960
Use my card.

62
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,599
Just go ahead and use mine.

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,799
You can pay me back later.

64
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:23,879
Are you sure?

65
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah.

66
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,479
Got it!

67
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,039
OK.

68
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,799
Please wrap it up for me.

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Can I add you on WeChat?

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,560
I'll transfer the money to you later.

71
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,680
Alright.

72
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,160
Thank you so much!

73
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,319
You're welcome.

74
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,599
You look stunning.

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,120
What a waste of time.

76
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
We waited nearly two hours.

77
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,359
But Mr. Xia still didn't show up.

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,359
I just found out

79
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
that Mr. Xing from section two

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,240
ambushed him at the hotel.

81
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:04,919
Originally, Mr. Xia

82
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,799
wasn't planning to meet anyone.

83
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:06,960
But Mr. Xing

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
dressed up as a

85
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,560
hotel staff member.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,079
He even made a name tag,

87
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,280
looking quite convincing,

88
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,720
and ambushed Mr. Xia right

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
at the door of his suite.

90
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,759
[That was quite a sneaky tactic.]

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,359
We are sales.

92
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,720
It's all about performance.

93
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:22,799
For a big project like

94
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,599
Weiji Company,

95
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,440
it's normal for

96
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,199
Mr. Xing to

97
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,160
use some tricks.

98
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,239
But you,

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,359
that's quite some inside scoop you got.

100
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:32,640
Folks from section two

101
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,439
are pretty loose-lipped.

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,039
Well, I've been working for Dairui

103
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:35,960
for so many years.

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
It's normal to have

105
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,880
one or two close friends.

106
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,599
But don't worry,

107
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,039
I may brag a lot,

108
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:42,880
but when it comes to business,

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm very discreet.

110
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,200
They can't pick up

111
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,479
on anything

112
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,119
from

113
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,960
our team.

114
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,039
What is it?

115
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,960
What is

116
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,119
on the seat?

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,760
It belongs to your secret lover.

118
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,479
What lover?

119
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,280
Mind your own business.

120
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,039
What business do I have?

121
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,880
You have a crush on Rao Jing.

122
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,640
Do you think I can't see that?

123
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,640
I have a crush on her?

124
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,520
How could I possibly like her?

125
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,799
I wasn't asking you.

126
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,679
I was simply making a statement.

127
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,160
What statement?

128
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,320
She might not even be interested in me.

129
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,720
She looks thrilled.

130
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,320
Could it be that

131
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,119
she officially started dating the boss?

132
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,200
But,

133
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,280
the hair tie in

134
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,439
his car doesn't

135
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,160
look like something Yuhui would use.

136
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
Whose hair tie was left in the boss' car?

137
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,359
[Is it that special,]

138
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,080
[mysterious girl?]

139
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,239
[She officially started dating the boss?]

140
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,520
What are you guys talking about?

141
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:10,559
Get back to work.

142
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,919
A hair tie in the boss' car?

143
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,280
You must have seen things.

144
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,960
[How could there be a hair tie?]

145
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:17,599
[Maybe it's]

146
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,400
[a rubber band]

147
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,559
[or something else.]

148
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,239
- It's all possible.
- Am I blind to you?

149
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,559
There's a Shiba Inu on it.

150
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,919
[Shiba Inu?]

151
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:28,840
Shiba Inu...

152
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,599
I remember someone wearing it before.

153
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:32,520
Xiaoning,

154
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,799
didn't you

155
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,760
have one before?

156
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,320
A Shiba Inu hair tie?

157
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,439
Maybe.

158
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,200
I can't really remember.

159
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:43,200
[Recently,]

160
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,119
[that hair tie has become quite popular.]

161
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:45,960
A lot of girls have it.

162
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,119
You've got one too, right?

163
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,720
Yeah, it's pretty trendy.

164
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,080
[Is there really something going on]

165
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,520
[between them?]

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,239
The group photo we took last time

167
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,439
has been posted on the internal network.

168
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,280
Check the homepage.

169
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,119
Go take a look, guys.

170
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,039
OK.

171
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,280
Zhao Fanggang, did

172
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,520
you hire that photographer?

173
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,559
Yeah.

174
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:10,640
No wonder

175
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,119
he made your face look so small

176
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,160
and made mine look so big,

177
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,799
like a big pancake.

178
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,640
[Were you doing that on purpose?]

179
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,200
I think you look pretty good.

180
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,439
Broad-minded and broad face.

181
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:24,479
Get lost.

182
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,799
Xiaoning,

183
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,960
you look pretty good in that shot.

184
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,799
[You standing next to the boss,]

185
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,599
[at first glance,]

186
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:32,960
[it looks a bit like]

187
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,960
[a wedding photo.]

188
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,840
Nah, not even close.

189
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,239
It's worlds apart.

190
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,760
It's not even a luxury brand

191
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,520
which may cost a couple of thousands.

192
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,760
That hair tie of yours is everywhere.

193
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,200
Just deny it.

194
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,880
You'll be fine.

195
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
I might be able to get through it.

196
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,119
But living like this every day,

197
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,039
always on edge...

198
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,479
I've been very careful already.

199
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,039
I have to be extra careful.

200
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,080
It's exhausting!

201
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
So,

202
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,439
all your worries for now

203
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,479
are just a waste of energy.

204
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,999
You two just take it as it comes,

205
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
deal with whatever comes your way.

206
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,999
It's been so long without being discovered,

207
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
which shows your acting skills are solid.

208
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,960
You'll be fine.

209
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,479
I hope so.

210
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,039
I'd like to check out that store.

211
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,080
Hey, stop!

212
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,599
You've bought so much already.

213
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,999
I've only got two arms.

214
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,520
Just one more, that's it.

215
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,400
If you keep buying,

216
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
my arms will break.

217
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,280
Wait until Qi Yu is free.

218
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,200
You can ask him to shop with you.

219
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,080
The name "Qi Yu"

220
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,359
is today's taboo word.

221
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,400
Taboo?

222
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,439
What's wrong?

223
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,160
What did he do wrong?

224
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,080
At least fill me in on the details

225
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,199
about what was going on.

226
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,880
He actually returned the leather shoes

227
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,360
that I carefully selected for him.

228
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,079
Those were meant to be

229
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:54,959
a gift for his new job.

230
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:56,559
And then,

231
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,959
he said it was because

232
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,039
the money I used to buy the shoes

233
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,839
came from my dad.

234
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,559
He didn't want to spend my dad's money.

235
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:06,079
Everything I've had since childhood:

236
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,039
food, drinks, toys

237
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,919
have all been paid for

238
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,880
with my dad's money!

239
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Wasn't he saying I'm living off my dad?

240
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,240
He definitely didn't mean it that way.

241
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,360
That's exactly what he meant.

242
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,120
Now he's become

243
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,000
a police officer,

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,880
so full of righteousness,

245
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,520
even pointing fingers at me.

246
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,240
That wasn't

247
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,199
really fair to him.

248
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,760
What's not fair about it?

249
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,760
You know him

250
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,559
better than anyone.

251
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,480
And I know you

252
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,280
better than anyone.

253
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,079
You're just

254
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:32,959
venting right now.

255
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,120
Anyway,

256
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:36,959
he took it upon himself

257
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,280
to return the shoes I bought him.

258
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,600
That's his fault.

259
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,319
You can tell him he's wrong.

260
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:42,959
You could even have a fight with him.

261
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,719
Regardless,

262
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,880
you should call him over now.

263
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm not taking

264
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,959
all those

265
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,000
to your car.

266
00:09:59,079 --> 00:09:59,559
Fine, I'll call him.

267
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,400
I just need someone to carry the stuff.

268
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:13,600
Weiyi.

269
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,640
The weather is lovely.

270
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's go out for a walk.

271
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,439
I'll see how you'll explain yourself.

272
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,280
A couple of days ago,

273
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,319
I was playing basketball with Yuheng.

274
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,400
We brought up the mortgage issue.

275
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,719
Who needs a loan?

276
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,240
If we're getting married in the future,

277
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,000
we need a place to live, right?

278
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,719
With my current income,

279
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,760
the down payment is quite challenging.

280
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,400
Let alone paying in full.

281
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,400
Just take your time.

282
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
No one is rushing you.

283
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,319
True, no one is rushing me,

284
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,839
but since I want to be with you,

285
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
I need to be able to support

286
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,319
our life together.

287
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,559
[I have to take good care of you.]

288
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,559
Because I know

289
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Ling Weiyi has high standards,

290
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,280
and they're right here.

291
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:07,240
They might even be higher.

292
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:08,600
I might not be able to meet them now.

293
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,360
But I truly believe that

294
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
in the future, I'll definitely meet them.

295
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,439
[I don't want you to]

296
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:16,160
[lower your standards]

297
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,799
[just because you're with me.]

298
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:18,719
[I don't want you to lower your standards.]

299
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,400
And about those shoes,

300
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:27,760
how could I

301
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,240
not be happy

302
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,039
when my girlfriend gives me a gift?

303
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,760
I was thrilled.

304
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,799
I was truly happy about it.

305
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,880
But I don't want to

306
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,439
spend your money or your dad's money

307
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:37,719
however I please.

308
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,160
That was my gift to you,

309
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,240
for your new job!

310
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,719
It's likely that this is the only time

311
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,039
you start a job in your life.

312
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,079
This is really meaningful,

313
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,600
alright?

314
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,839
Can't you just accept it this time

315
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,280
and save your argument for my next buy.

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,640
Don't worry,

317
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,880
I've got it all figured out.

318
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,600
On top of my daily expenses,

319
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
I'll save the rest of my salary.

320
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,799
I'll be able to buy those shoes back

321
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,360
real soon.

322
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,160
By then,

323
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I'll wear them with my police uniform

324
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,679
and show you. How does that sound?

325
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,919
Don't be upset anymore.

326
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,079
You've got dark circles under your eyes.

327
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,319
Have you been staying up late again?

328
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,199
It's OK.

329
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,919
I just joined the force recently.

330
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
There's a lot to learn.

331
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,760
It's fine.

332
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,559
So it's deal.

333
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,000
You'll soon

334
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,039
buy those shoes back.

335
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,240
It's a promise.

336
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,120
Don't be upset.

337
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,000
Let's go.

338
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,799
That's more like it.

339
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,120
Buy them back ASAP.

340
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:56,240
It's finally done.

341
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,839
The working spirit of a laborer...

342
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,400
No one knows when

343
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,719
I'll be able to make a fortune.

344
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:52,400
One, two...

345
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,719
One more time.

346
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,160
Think.

347
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,039
Who is it?

348
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:06,559
Hello?

349
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,319
It takes you forever to answer a call.

350
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:09,160
Are you afraid I'll hound you

351
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,959
or something?

352
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Who is this?

353
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,760
It's stingy dude!

354
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,000
Have you been drinking?

355
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,120
Yeah...

356
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
I found your name tag.

357
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,760
Nothing else,

358
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:23,679
just wanted to let you know.

359
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,039
I was worried you might panic.

360
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,959
I'm hanging up now.

361
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,000
No rush.

362
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,520
You can keep it for yourself.

363
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,039
Just let it stay there and have babies.

364
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,199
I'm home now.

365
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:32,799
Are you OK?

366
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,839
Have you made it home?

367
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,799
Where are you?

368
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,839
Hello?

369
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,120
Hello?

370
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,199
At the door,

371
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,120
there's a pair

372
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,160
of size 42 men's shoes.

373
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,120
Don't forget to

374
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,280
put them there.

375
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,600
Then tomorrow morning,

376
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,160
after you get up,

377
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
change the password

378
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,600
for my lock of

379
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,120
the door.

380
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:18,839
Got it.

381
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,199
Change the password.

382
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,679
Your security awareness

383
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,480
is quite impressive.

384
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:26,280
Isn't it necessary to be cautious?

385
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,039
A beautiful woman living alone.

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,160
You know what,

387
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,439
one time at my apartment,

388
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,480
the elevator broke down.

389
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,039
I had to take the stairs to get up.

390
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,839
You know what I saw

391
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,559
in the stairwell?

392
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,760
What?

393
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,919
A huge graffiti of

394
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,880
a naked woman.

395
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,000
How frightening and provocative!

396
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,839
Then what happened?

397
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,919
Then,

398
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
the next day, I wiped it off.

399
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,719
But my house

400
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,839
still got robbed.

401
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,439
Fortunately, I was at the office that day,

402
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,719
working late.

403
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,280
Otherwise,

404
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,240
what if that thief

405
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,719
was tempted

406
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,199
by my beauty?

407
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,679
At least you were safe.

408
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,000
You were lucky.

409
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,880
Lucky?

410
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,400
What's so lucky about it?

411
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,120
Stingy dude.

412
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,799
Why am I sharing all this

413
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,319
with you?

414
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,959
[That wasn't fun at all.]

415
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
You're a fun dude.

416
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,120
That's why I'm telling you all this.

417
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,360
Don't laugh.

418
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
Actually, you're not that fun.

419
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,000
You need to be

420
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,160
with me

421
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,600
to be fun.

422
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,679
Hey,

423
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,160
knock it off.

424
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,959
I'm not falling for that.

425
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,280
Do two people really

426
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,079
have to be together?

427
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,479
Once you're together,

428
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,919
a lot more problems arise.

429
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,279
More responsibilities,

430
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,800
burdens multiply,

431
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,800
it all becomes a hassle.

432
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,320
You might even end up breaking up.

433
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,560
And after a breakup,

434
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,719
you won't even be friends.

435
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,840
Not even someone to banter with.

436
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,320
How dull is that?

437
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,239
If you haven't thought it through, fine.

438
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,360
I'm heading home.

439
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,719
You should get some rest.

440
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,239
Once my stepping out,

441
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:10,600
you lock the door

442
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
from the inside.

443
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,239
I'll be off after hearing you tap it.

444
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,959
You care about me so much,

445
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,800
why do you still want to leave?

446
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,479
Have you thought it through?

447
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,239
Forget about thinking!

448
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:47,679
Why is this so hard to take off.

449
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,640
Next time,

450
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,640
can you wear something with

451
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,239
a zipper?

452
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,400
Rao Jing.

453
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,120
Is that it?

454
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,840
Qi Yu posted

455
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,160
the photo of the two of them.

456
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
Looks like they're good now.

457
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,560
Qi Yu returned

458
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
the shoes Ling Weiyi bought.

459
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:05,880
Actually, I think

460
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,600
it's a good thing.

461
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,840
Think about it.

462
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,360
When two people are dating,

463
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,999
they should make progress, right?

464
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
You can't always live your life

465
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,439
like it's just a game.

466
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:17,919
Right?

467
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:27,719
Is it

468
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,679
not going well

469
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,199
with Weiji's case?

470
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,199
You got me on that.

471
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,120
It's a bit tough.

472
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,360
If no one can make a breakthrough

473
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,439
in the proposal,

474
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,800
no one could

475
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,840
really impress Mr. Xia.

476
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,679
But you know,

477
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,880
the offers from

478
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,239
various banks are pretty much the same.

479
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,199
We've already hit a wall.

480
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,600
This is a deadlock.

481
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,120
Someone needs to break it.

482
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,519
I spent

483
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,719
the entire afternoon

484
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:00,919
thinking about it.

485
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,120
But I still can't find a

486
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,479
better way out of this.

487
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,040
If

488
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,160
I can't secure the deal with Weiji,

489
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,279
I could just kiss the position of

490
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:16,640
the president of Jian Branch goodbye.

491
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,600
In the coming years,

492
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,160
I could only hold on to

493
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,120
the position of department manager,

494
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,719
with no prospects ahead.

495
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:25,600
And one more thing,

496
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,840
I actually don't want Xing Zhen

497
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,400
to take the position of president.

498
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,360
Don't worry.

499
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,479
Take your time.

500
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,239
I have confidence in you anyway.

501
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
You are Ji Yuheng, after all.

502
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,439
To be honest,

503
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,479
the pressure is really intense.

504
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,600
Give me a hug.

505
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,199
Let's go.

506
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,040
Go.

507
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,479
[You're so young and already managers.]

508
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:56,360
[Please take good care]

509
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,519
[of her at work.]

510
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,560
[This kid]

511
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,679
[is really]

512
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,640
[kind-hearted.]

513
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,239
[Sorry, Mr. Ji, there's ]

514
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:06,560
[only one cup of Aurelio White left.]

515
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:07,919
[Fine, I'll take it.]

516
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,479
[Yuheng, that's Aurelio White.]

517
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,959
[It's actually quite good.]

518
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,519
While Yuheng's mom

519
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,679
was sick,

520
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,560
you really put in a lot of effort.

521
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,239
Tu Xiaoning,

522
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,040
I underestimated you.

523
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,040
This is good enough.

524
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:42,999
Don't need to go harder.

525
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:46,560
By the way,

526
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,560
Zhao Fang just texted me.

527
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,120
He said the proposals from

528
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Shentong and Guangming

529
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
have been rejected already.

530
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,719
Mr. Xia didn't show up,

531
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,199
but had the accounting department

532
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,040
send a

533
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,919
confirmation message.

534
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,560
With two rivals out,

535
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,800
that's a good thing.

536
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,840
Mr. Ji,

537
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,439
you're one step closer to success.

538
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,279
Based on this theory of yours,

539
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,519
I don't need to prepare at all.

540
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:12,239
I can just rely on luck.

541
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,479
If luck is on my side,

542
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:14,320
I might just make it

543
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,160
to the final round.

544
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,120
Some things are just like that.

545
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,519
This is known as the law of attraction.

546
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,360
As long as you keep

547
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,679
a positive attitude every day

548
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,439
good things

549
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,880
will come your way.

550
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,479
Like what?

551
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,519
For instance,

552
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,919
Miss Tu saw that you

553
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,239
need to lift your spirits,

554
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,239
and she wants to cheer you up,

555
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,320
so she comes over to comfort you.

556
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,560
Does that count?

557
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:37,840
Absolutely.

558
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,279
Come on,

559
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,239
it's my turn to give you a massage.

560
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,479
Just relax.

561
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,919
Actually,

562
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,199
when it comes to adjusting your mindset

563
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,560
and encouraging yourself,

564
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,600
I could be your mentor.

565
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,999
You could be my what?

566
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:06,880
A mentor.

567
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,840
I actually thought of

568
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,719
a good angle.

569
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,519
Yes, Miss Fang.

570
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,199
Come on, I'm in a good mood today.

571
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,199
Who hasn't had breakfast?

572
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:25,640
Go ahead, have some.

573
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,439
Good morning, Jing.

574
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:26,840
Thank you, Jing.

575
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,160
Morning.

576
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,840
You recovered from the hangover fast!

577
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,640
I'm not like the others, can't even

578
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,080
walk a straight line when drunk.

579
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Looks like you don't remember

580
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,040
anything from last night.

581
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:37,959
Last night?

582
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,959
What happened last night?

583
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:40,919
What should I remember?

584
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,560
Let me think.

585
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,679
Oh yeah,

586
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,439
did I tell you to

587
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,519
remind me to change the password?

588
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,479
I changed it when I went out this morning.

589
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,880
Miss!

590
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:58,999
Rao,

591
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
here is the information on the client,

592
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,439
take a look.

593
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,120
You scared me.

594
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,759
You really should go check out

595
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,360
this problem of

596
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,519
blacking out after drinking.

597
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:11,840
Why else would you drink?

598
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,600
Yes,

599
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,239
you can come directly to the

600
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,239
sub-branch to find me, Miss Fang.

601
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,840
Do you have my electronic business card?

602
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:30,959
Okay.

603
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,919
Then I'll see you here.

604
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:32,880
Yes, okay.

605
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:33,320
Goodbye.

606
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,800
Jing,

607
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,120
I've been working

10608
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,519
with a client named Fang Xiaoyun.

609
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,360
[But this Miss Fang]

610
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,400
[is already in the system.]

10611
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,040
She has been under Yao Jia's name

612
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,279
in Section Two for two years.

613
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,400
But the account is not even activated,

614
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,679
nor there is any company information.

615
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,600
What should I do?

616
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,400
Normally, you need to fill out

617
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,360
an account transfer request.

10618
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,479
And then just transfer Yao Jia's

619
00:26:59,479 --> 00:26:59,999
personal data

620
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:00,840
over to you.

10621
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,279
Hello, Yao Jia.

622
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,759
I'm Tu Xiaoning, from Section One.

623
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,239
Today I was talking with a client

624
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,360
named Fang Xiaoyun.

625
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,719
When I was registering her I saw that

626
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,080
you already opened an account for her

627
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,880
2 years ago, but it was never activated.

628
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,679
Would it be

629
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,800
convenient for you if we

630
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,600
do the account transfer today?

631
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,840
Transfer a client from my system?

632
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,679
You're stealing in broad daylight.

633
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,160
[I don't get to make this decision.]

634
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,959
[Ask the boss.]

635
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,919
It's been two years and it hasn't...

636
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,919
Poaching clients this blatantly.

637
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,040
[People would think]

638
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,560
[that we are all robbers.]

639
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,320
[Won't you be embarrassed if it gets out?]

640
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,320
Why can't I

641
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,800
contact a client

642
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,840
who hasn't been activated for two years?

643
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,320
Didn't you hear what

644
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,439
Jing just said?

645
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,080
Tu Xiaoning,

646
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,199
do you really not care at all

647
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:48,919
[if those shameless things you did]

648
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,239
[get out?]

649
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,400
Do you think you'll still have a place

650
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,719
at this bank if everyone finds out?

651
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:54,600
[What shameless things]

652
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,679
[did I do?]

653
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,919
[I followed the regulations.]

654
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,479
Why won't I have a place here?

655
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,320
You followed the regulations?

656
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,239
Yuhui,

657
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,679
[you're being too harsh.]

658
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
It's not your client.

659
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,160
Even if you're in a bad mood,

660
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
you shouldn't lash out at others.

661
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,479
Did you all have a bad breakfast

662
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,080
this morning or what!

663
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,999
[If the bank's president finds out,]

664
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
[he'll definitely let her go]

665
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,239
[to protect Yuheng.]

666
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,199
[Who does she think she is,]

667
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,519
[seducing the department leader?]

668
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,360
[She really doesn't know her place!]

669
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,560
[Yuheng,]

670
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,239
[take a seat first.]

671
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:43,479
[About the Weiji Group,]

672
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,600
I've thought about it more carefully.

673
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,519
Originally,

674
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:47,999
Weiji Group's business

675
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:48,719
was centered in the U.S.

676
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,800
[The domestic resort project]

677
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,840
[started]

678
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,880
[only three years ago.]

679
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:53,759
But its development

680
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:54,800
lags far behind that of the U.S.

681
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,560
So, I think for Mr. Xia,

682
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,919
having a financial expert

683
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,679
who understands the domestic market

684
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,719
and can plan

685
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,479
how to use the funds well

686
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:04,479
[for him]

687
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:05,199
[is likely more important]

688
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,360
[than how much money]

689
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,880
[can be raised.]

690
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:09,800
Do we have any suitable candidates?

691
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,880
My advisor from college,

10692
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,759
Jia Ziqing.

693
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,999
[Professor Jia is one]

694
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,679
[of the top economists in the country.]

695
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:21,679
[If we could get Professor Jia]

696
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,999
[to do the financial plan]

697
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,160
for Weiji's resort project,

698
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,479
I think Mr. Xia might be interested.

699
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,880
[This is a good idea.]

700
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,679
[But,]

701
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,880
about your advisor.

702
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,519
I will go to Jinghai

703
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,800
this weekend

704
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:38,719
and invite him myself.

705
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:39,959
Be quick.

706
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,840
We can't let a big catch like Weiji

707
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
slip away.

708
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,080
Understood.

709
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,199
[I must have lost my mind from anger.]

710
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,040
[Why would I lower myself]

711
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,400
[to Tu Xiaoning's level?]

712
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,479
[I should focus more on Yuheng]

713
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,439
[and let him see my value.]

714
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,320
Hello,

715
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,439
Mr. Jia?

716
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,479
This is Yuhui.

717
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,040
I'm doing well.

718
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,279
Just the usual banking stuff.

719
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,320
I'm sure it's all nothing to you.

720
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,239
Yeah,

721
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,519
I want to ask you

722
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,880
for a favor.

723
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,759
Do you have time on Saturday?

724
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:26,880
I'll go visit you in Jinghai.

725
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:29,360
Okay.

726
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:30,679
See you then.

727
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:48,719
What happened?

10728
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,080
Yao Jia came with Mr. Xing

729
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:51,999
to talk to you about

730
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,600
the account transfer I did from Yao Jia.

731
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:56,880
Let's go see.

732
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,840
You do have the best tea here.

733
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,400
I was wondering why all the bosses

734
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,320
always come here for tea.

735
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:18,840
Where did you get it?

736
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,199
Mr. Xing,

737
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,120
this is our company's tea.

738
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:28,880
Mr. Ji,

739
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,239
I know that your department's

740
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
performance is great right now.

741
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,600
But isn't the Section One

742
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,400
overstepping a little?

743
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,999
[Xiaoning]

744
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,080
[came to out department]

745
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
[early this morning,]

746
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,679
[demanding to transfer Yao Jia's client.]

747
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:44,519
Isn't this

748
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,160
a bit too much?

749
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:47,959
Really?

750
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:49,679
Xiaoning,

751
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,759
how did you get this client?

752
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,999
Mr. Liu from Longhu Glass,

753
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,759
with whom I've worked before,

754
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,880
has also collaborated with Miss Fang.

755
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,519
[He's an upstream client of Miss fang.]

756
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,320
[Miss fang thought]

757
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:01,999
[the deposit plan]

758
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:03,320
[I did for Mr. Liu]

759
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:03,999
[was not bad.]

760
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:04,880
She was interested as well, so

761
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:06,199
she made an appointment to talk with me.

762
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,199
And then

763
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
she signed the cooperation agreement.

764
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,040
Don't you have any shame at all?

765
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:11,959
Sugarcoating client poaching

766
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,040
like that.

767
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,239
Here's the situation,

768
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,040
the thing is,

769
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,199
this client

770
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,840
was originally

771
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,999
one of Yao Jia's clients.

772
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,560
[You transferred]

773
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,840
[the client's information]

774
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,080
without giving any prior notice,

775
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,400
isn't this a bit

776
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,880
against the rules?

777
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,080
Mr. Ji,

778
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:34,999
there's nothing wrong

779
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:35,759
with chasing better results,

780
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,679
but anyway,

781
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,439
don't you think you should

782
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:40,160
leave something for us

783
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,320
in the other departments too?

784
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:43,679
I don't really understand

785
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,679
what you're saying, Mr. Xing.

786
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,040
According to the bank's regulations,

787
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,400
if a client

788
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,959
is in a credit system

789
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,080
[and isn't activated]

790
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
[within a year,]

791
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,959
[then they are considered a new client.]

792
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,560
How can a client

793
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,279
that Xiaoning found herself

794
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,040
be considered poaching

795
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
from you?

796
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:01,080
[And you even went to the trouble of]

797
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,120
[coming to Section One yourself?]

798
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,560
[Then you must have been]

799
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,080
struggling with this job.

800
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,080
How about this,

801
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,560
we all work for

802
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,519
the same bank after all,

803
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,360
let's not fight among ourselves.

804
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:19,880
Xiaoning,

805
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,439
call that client.

806
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,959
Since we're all here,

807
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,560
let the client choose herself.

808
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,519
[If the client]

809
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,199
[prefers Section Two's]

810
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:29,840
[Miss Yao]

811
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,679
[to take over,]

812
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,160
then we'll gladly

813
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,360
hand over this client.

814
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:34,880
Okay.

815
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:39,719
Fine, fine.

816
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,360
Do it, do it.

817
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:42,040
Do the transfer.

818
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:43,400
It's yours.

819
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,239
Section Two doesn't need

820
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,880
such a minor client anyway.

821
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,679
Mr. Xing.

822
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,439
What are you still doing with

823
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,439
such a client

824
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,679
that hasn't brought in anything

825
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:53,959
after two years?

826
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,840
[If they want her,]

827
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,279
[just hand it over]

828
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,279
[generously.]

829
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,679
Let's see if they can

830
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,959
turn such clients into a gold mine

831
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,959
or what!

832
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,199
Go back now.

833
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,600
Go back.

834
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:23,519
Get back to work now.

835
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,519
Okay.

836
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,040
Mr. Xing I'll get back to work then.

837
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:36,440
Mr. Xing, is there anything else?

838
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,160
Mr. Ji,

839
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,080
let's not let the conflicts

840
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,560
between our subordinates interfere with

841
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,920
the relationship between us brothers.

842
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,000
[Brother,]

843
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,560
[look,]

844
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,279
now I

845
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,239
have given you the client,

846
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:54,480
as well as

847
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,000
the face.

848
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,679
Tell me the truth,

849
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,719
how did it go

850
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,920
with Weiji Group?

851
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,520
Weiji Group?

852
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:05,480
To be honest,

853
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,000
I still haven't even been able to

854
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,719
meet Mr. Xia in person yet.

855
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,920
In the end,

856
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,960
it's like you said,

857
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,640
[Weiji Group is nothing more than]

858
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,560
[a client.]

859
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,440
It's not like

860
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,879
if you don't sign this one,

861
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,640
you won't be able to

862
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,799
keep this job anymore, right?

863
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,600
[I think,]

864
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:27,799
[we should both]

865
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:29,359
take it easy

866
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,879
and not put

867
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,799
too much pressure on ourselves,

868
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,199
don't you think so?

869
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,319
So, Mr. Xing, you didn't really come over

870
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,879
for the transfer today, you came

871
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,040
to convince me to give up on Weiji.

872
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,399
No.

873
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:41,839
Sure,

874
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:43,799
I'll think about it.

875
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,839
If Professor Jia agrees

876
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:48,640
to be Weiji Group's

877
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,719
financial advisor,

878
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,799
then Weiji will surely

879
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:51,520
collaborate with us.

880
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,440
I agree with

881
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,520
what you said as well.

882
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,000
Looks like students of the same teacher

883
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,480
do share

884
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,560
a sense of mutual understanding.

885
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,040
Anything else?

886
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,160
I'm going to visit Professor Jia

887
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
at university this Saturday.

888
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:04,879
If you're going

889
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:05,960
this weekend as well,

890
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,719
let's go together.

891
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,399
We're from the same company

892
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,520
and the same department,

893
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:12,679
it would be very strange

894
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,719
if we go separately

895
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,679
on the same day.

896
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:15,960
Sure.

897
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
I'll take care of the plane tickets.

898
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:18,560
I'll send you

899
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,600
the booking information later.

900
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,480
Yuheng,

901
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:24,239
do you think

902
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:25,719
there are too many different

903
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,319
people in our department?

904
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,359
It's about quality

905
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,640
not quantity.

906
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,679
I know you.

907
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,080
You like challenges,

908
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,040
but you always handle things

909
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,199
with integrity.

910
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,239
Yuhui, if you do know me,

911
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,120
then you should know that

912
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,359
the thing I dislike the most

913
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,040
is the people who

914
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,839
make mischief in their own department.

915
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,600
The bank has clear regulations,

916
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:47,600
we should handle clients

917
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:49,160
according to the rules.

918
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,440
No,

919
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,000
that's not what I meant.

920
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,120
I mean,

921
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:54,000
some people,

922
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,520
like Tu Xiaoning,

923
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,440
would poach someone else's client

924
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,759
[for a mere million, they]

925
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,520
[even came to our department for this.]

926
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,359
[It's really quite disgraceful.]

927
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,600
Mr. Ji.

928
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:05,879
Yuhui,

929
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,319
there are always ways to vent

930
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:10,120
when you're in a bad mood.

931
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,759
But you already picked on Xiaoning

932
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:13,279
this morning at the office.

933
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
[And now after work,]

934
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,040
[you're still stabbing her in the back]

935
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,399
[in front of Mr. Ji.]

936
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,879
[I really do think]

937
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,399
this is a bit inappropriate.

938
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,000
Jing,

939
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,679
I didn't stab

940
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,920
anyone in the back.

941
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,839
I'm just stating the facts.

942
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,600
And speaking of facts,

943
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,040
there was no such thing as

944
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,279
poaching clients,

945
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:29,960
so you don't need to

946
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,160
bring this up anymore.

947
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,359
A mere million?

948
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:35,040
[One of the most important aspects]

949
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,000
about our job is to bring in

950
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,799
more deposits for the bank diligently.

951
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:37,920
Over the years,

952
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,719
Xu Li, Mr. Zhao, and I

953
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,399
have all been focused on bringing in

954
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,719
deposits, issuing loans, and accumulating

955
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,000
clients and resources for the bank.

956
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,359
Right, Mr. Zhao?

957
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,399
Here's the thing,

958
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,600
if Xiaoning

959
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,879
didn't contact this client,

10960
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,560
whom Yao Jia hasn't activated for years,

961
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:02,440
then we would lose

962
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,199
this client, right?

963
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:13,199
Okay then.

964
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:14,719
If there's nothing else,

965
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,399
let's all leave.

966
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,239
Working overtime in the underground

967
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,080
parking garage doesn't get you extra pay.

968
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,120
I'll leave too.

969
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,160
I'll leave too.

970
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,799
Can you fix an electricity meter?

971
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,719
I said, can you fix an electricity meter?

972
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,480
Your electricity meter is broken?

973
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:45,759
Yes.

974
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,160
The circuit breaker keeps tripping lately.

975
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,120
I tried to fix it for a few days.

976
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,920
But I couldn't.

977
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,560
If you have some time

978
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,799
this weekend,

979
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,040
will you come fix it for me?

980
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,239
Why are you asking me instead of

981
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,480
looking for an electrician?

982
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,080
You don't want to?

983
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:06,879
Fine.

984
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:10,399
I'm mainly concerned about your money.

985
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:11,000
[See you on the weekend.]

986
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,560
Mr. Xing hasn't made things difficult

987
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,160
to you about the client transfer,

988
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
and bothered you anymore, right?

989
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,359
No.

990
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,399
Good then.

991
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,799
Actually he knew very well

992
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
what's right and what's wrong.

993
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:28,560
In the future, when it comes to work,

994
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:29,960
you should fight when needed.

995
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,199
Or all your hard work

996
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,239
would become a stepping stone for others.

10997
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,920
Yao Jia was not cooperative at first

998
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,080
was also because

999
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,279
she saw the potential.

1000
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,000
If we let something like this slide

1001
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,679
this time, then

1002
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,679
they'll just keep pushing their luck

1003
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,520
and it will never end.

1004
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,120
Oh right,

1005
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,120
I booked a ticket

1006
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:48,480
for a business trip

1007
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,560
after work this Friday to Jinghai

1008
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,920
with

1009
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:51,920
Tang Yuhui.

1010
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:00,040
Professor Jia was her advisor as well.

1011
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,080
She contacted him first.

1012
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,759
It's more appropriate if we go together.

1013
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,879
I didn't say anything.

1014
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,640
Mr. Ji,

1015
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,199
you're very cautious now.

1016
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,960
But don't worry.

1017
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,520
I booked a ticket for you as well.

1018
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,960
What do you mean?

1019
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm going too?

1020
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,239
Wouldn't it be strange

1021
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,960
if the three of us go together?

1022
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,239
Plus Tang Yuhui is pretty smart.

1023
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,799
What if she finds out?

1024
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,239
It's the weekend anyway.

1025
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,399
I'll take you out and show you around

1026
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:29,040
Jinghai when I'm done working.

1027
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,040
Actually it's fine.

1028
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,120
I won't overthink.

1029
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:34,719
Okay.

1030
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:35,359
Don't worry.

1031
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:36,600
I already planned everything.

1032
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,000
Consider it

1033
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:39,080
a short trip

1034
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,120
to relax yourself,

1035
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:41,440
okay?

1036
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,000
Okay.

1037
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,120
Let's go.

1038
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,560
Can you still run?

1039
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,399
This way, please.

1040
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:52,160
Welcome abroad.

1041
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,359
Hello, ma'am,

1042
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,839
do you need help with your bag?

1043
00:40:59,399 --> 00:40:59,960
Yes.

1044
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:01,160
Okay.

1045
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:06,960
[Mr. Ji,]

1046
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,719
[you're way too bold now,]

1047
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,679
[you bought the same flight?]

1048
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,040
[It's not okay?]

1049
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
[Aren't you afraid]

1050
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,920
[Tang Yuhui will find out?]

1051
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,359
[It's okay.]

1052
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
[I just wanted to take you]

1053
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:28,359
[to see my old university.]

1054
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:43,839
Yuheng,

1055
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,839
when you went to talk about

1056
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,679
the Zhouyang contract last time,

1057
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,000
did you have a reunion

1058
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,960
with our old classmates at Jinghai?

1059
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:51,759
I didn't.

1060
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,480
Last time I was in a hurry.

1061
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,359
Well then,

1062
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,000
perfect.

1063
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,279
I want to organize a reunion with

1064
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,759
our classmates when we're free these days,

1065
00:41:58,759 --> 00:41:59,920
just to talk and catch up.

1066
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,080
Tomorrow is the weekend, you're

1067
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,759
free to do anything with your own time.

1068
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,279
If they want,

1069
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,600
I can be the financial advisor

1070
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,199
for this financing project.

1071
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,160
That would be great!

1072
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,359
Thank you, Professor Jia.

1073
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,600
[You've really helped us a lot.]

1074
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,520
Professor,

1075
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,960
when you come to Xing City,

1076
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,719
Yuheng and I

1077
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,920
will definitely show you around.

1078
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:52,600
Okay.

1079
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,520
I might just take you up on it.

1080
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,279
Are you two

1081
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,279
close to sealing the deal?

1082
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,440
Professor, don't make jokes.

1083
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,080
[You're still this gossipy.]

1084
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,040
Back in school,

1085
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,759
there were already some students

1086
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:10,080
spreading rumors about me and Yuheng.

1087
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:11,879
It must've been you who started it, right?

1088
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,080
[Professor Jia,]

1089
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,359
Yuhui and I

1090
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:15,879
are just colleagues.

1091
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:18,679
Yeah.

1092
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,679
Yuheng's right.

1093
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:20,679
[We are indeed]

1094
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:22,080
just colleagues now.

1095
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:23,920
He's a bit thin-skinned, Professor.

1096
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:25,160
[Stop joking around.]

1097
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,040
[I got it.]

1098
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:26,920
[Yuheng,]

1099
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:28,520
in relationships,

1100
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:30,279
it's better for men

1101
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:30,920
to take the initiative.

1102
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,520
Be steady, decisive, and precise.

1103
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,560
Otherwise,

1104
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:35,759
a great girl can be easily

1105
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:36,759
taken away by someone else.

1106
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:38,920
No...

1107
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:40,359
It's already late.

1108
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,960
As your professor,

1109
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:44,799
I should

1110
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,759
take you out to dinner

1111
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:46,640
when you come here.

1112
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
But today is Saturday.

1113
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,879
My grandson's in an early education class.

1114
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,080
[I need to go pick him up.]

1115
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,319
[We'll]

1116
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,000
just have to wait until I go to Xing city.

1117
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,040
Sure.

1118
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,719
Professor Jia, you go ahead.

1119
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,120
We'll wait for you in Xing city.

1120
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:58,960
Okay.

1121
00:43:59,239 --> 00:43:59,839
Okay, goodbye.

1122
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,440
Goodbye.

1123
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,960
Today is not the right time anyway.

1124
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,239
Next time,

1125
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:11,440
when Professor Jia goes to Xing city,

1126
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:12,759
I'll explain our relationship

1127
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:13,719
to him clearly.

1128
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,759
Actually I think some of the things

1129
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:18,520
Professor Jia said make sense.

1130
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:19,600
You should indeed know someone inside and

1131
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:20,799
out when it comes to finding a partner.

1132
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,239
This is where we

1133
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:26,359
met for the first time.

1134
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,560
A big package

1135
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,440
fell down from up there.

1136
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,679
Do you still remember?

1137
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:57,399
C'mon!

1138
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:08,879
Xiaoning,

1139
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,040
I think he's in charge of discipline.

1140
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,920
I saw.

1141
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Looks like you need to hurry.

1142
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,799
