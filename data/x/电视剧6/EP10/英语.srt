1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:46,120
You Are My Secret EP10

3
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:18,479
Xiaoning,

4
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:19,879
there's a document.

5
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,519
Take a good look at it.

6
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:21,680
Okay.

7
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,039
Xiaoning,

8
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
such a serious expression.

9
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,440
Land a big client?

10
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,039
No,

11
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,319
I'm signing up for

12
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,440
the permanent employee exam.

13
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,319
Pass the written test,

14
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,479
you're closer to getting permanent contract.

15
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,639
Keep it up.

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Thanks, Fanggang.

17
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,240
Everyone,

18
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,919
I just came back from HR.

19
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,440
Today is Mr. Ji's

20
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560
first birthday

21
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,599
in our department,

22
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,879
so HR

23
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,799
is preparing

24
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,919
a birthday cake for him.

25
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,400
Who's going to pick it up?

26
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,319
I'll go.

27
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,120
All right,

28
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,960
you go later then.

29
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,400
Okay.

30
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,759
Today is his birthday.

31
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,720
Ouch!

32
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,240
Ms. Rao,

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,759
I heard you landed

34
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,440
another big client.

35
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,280
Come on, it's the end of the year.

36
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,359
You're rat-racing us.

37
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,160
Xiaoning,

38
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,319
come to my office.

39
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,359
I need you to check some receipts.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,359
Okay.

41
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:33,640
Mr. Ji,

42
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:34,720
here's what you asked for.

43
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,239
Is it your birthday today?

44
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,679
Sit down.

45
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,760
What are you doing?

46
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,439
We're in your office.

47
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,679
What if someone sees us?

48
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:56,840
Don't move.

49
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,760
Just act natural. They can't see.

50
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,439
You're so careless.

51
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,640
Does it hurt?

52
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:06,880
No.

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,439
But if someone sees us,

54
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:13,799
it wouldn't be good.

55
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:16,720
All done.

56
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:18,320
Why didn't you

57
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,799
tell me it's your birthday?

58
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
As your future wife,

59
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,239
I didn't even know.

60
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,280
Am I too negligent?

61
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
Actually, I've always wanted

62
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,999
to make a cake

63
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,919
with someone on my birthday.

64
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,280
But

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,960
the company

66
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
is already preparing a cake for you.

67
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,760
But I don't like cream.

68
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,280
I prefer the cake base.

69
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:47,960
Cake base with coffee.

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,239
Sure,

71
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,999
got it.

72
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:52,439
So, it's settled then.

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,599
Xu Li,

74
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,280
Li Xiang,

75
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,479
today's

76
00:05:58,999 --> 00:05:59,559
our boss's

77
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,359
first birthday

78
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,200
with section one.

79
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,640
He doesn't seem

80
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:03,999
to have many friends.

81
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,239
Let's celebrate

82
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,239
his birthday after work.

83
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,119
It's sad

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,840
for him

85
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:10,720
to be alone.

86
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,080
What kind of

87
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,400
flour should we buy?

88
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,919
Let's use this

89
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:19,520
low-gluten one.

90
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
We also need some cornstarch

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,280
for better texture.

92
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,439
Cornstarch...

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,239
Over there.

94
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll get it.

95
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:32,559
Hello?

96
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:33,880
Boss,

97
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,520
I see you're not working late today.

98
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,359
Are you out

99
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,439
celebrating your birthday?

100
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,400
Any plans?

101
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
No way.

102
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm at home.

103
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,400
We're all at the supermarket

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,119
near your place now.

105
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,080
We're...

106
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,479
Isn't that Mr. Ji?

107
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:47,679
-Boss. -Boss.

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,400
If we hadn't come,

109
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,479
you'd have bought your stuff

110
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,039
and gone home alone

111
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,239
to celebrate your birthday.

112
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,400
How about hot pot tonight?

113
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,799
Sounds good.

114
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:16,960
There's a new

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,999
hot pot place nearby.

116
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,119
It's good.

117
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:19,679
Let's go,

118
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,239
I'll take you there.

119
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,439
Boss,

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,640
we should

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,320
be economical.

122
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,479
I think it's more cozy

123
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,559
to eat at home.

124
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,359
Everyone can

125
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,640
chat more comfortably.

126
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,039
Exactly.

127
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,359
That hot pot place

128
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,200
is quite good.

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
We can try it.

130
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,320
Don't worry,

131
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,880
we won't take up too much of your time.

132
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,439
Listen,

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,080
let's celebrate

134
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,720
at your place.

135
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,599
Look,

136
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,039
we already bought the ingredients.

137
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,559
Everyone can get to

138
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,880
know you better

139
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,400
and promote team harmony.

140
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,640
Are you worried

141
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,999
your place is too messy?

142
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:55,880
Come on,

143
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,119
which guy's place

144
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,119
isn't a bit messy?

145
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,999
Don't want us to come?

146
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,880
Of course not.

147
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,599
This one...

148
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,479
I think I heard

149
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,320
Xiaoning's voice?

150
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:21,720
Xiaoning?

151
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,479
What Xiaoning?

152
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,439
Xiaoning!

153
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
I forgot about her.

154
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,520
She left early today.

155
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,239
Did anyone tell her

156
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:27,960
about tonight's plans?

157
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:28,599
No.

158
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,080
Almost forgot.

159
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,960
I'll call her.

160
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:31,760
Hurry up.

161
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,640
She hung up on me!

162
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,479
I remember

163
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,439
Ms. Rao said something about

164
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,039
hosting a state-owned enterprise client.

165
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,559
State-owned enterprise client?

166
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,880
When did that happen?

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,520
I overheard it in the break room.

168
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,439
Maybe I heard wrong.

169
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,640
No,

170
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,520
she told me before leaving

171
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
that if it's confirmed

172
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,959
today is your birthday,

173
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
to let her know.

174
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,640
I'll call her.

175
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,799
We'll have hot pot

176
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,480
at home.

177
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,280
Let's buy a few more things.

178
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:03,959
Sure.

179
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,039
Looks like there's no stopping them.

180
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,760
I'll go home and prepare.

181
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:15,280
Ms. Rao,

182
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,400
we're all here to celebrate

183
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,240
the boss's birthday.

184
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,520
I heard

185
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,719
you secretly met with a client.

186
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,959
That's not cool.

187
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,079
I told you to wait for my message.

188
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,160
Why are you acting up?

189
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,600
She didn't go.

190
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,839
Okay,

191
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:34,640
I'll stall them.

192
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:36,240
Try to buy some time.

193
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,400
Unlocked.

194
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:44,880
Locked.

195
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:04,719
Well,

196
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
let's get another one of those

197
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,839
cheesy tender chickens.

198
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,240
More?

199
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,000
That's enough.

200
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,799
I'm hungry.

201
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,000
That should be enough.

202
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,079
Right.

203
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:16,880
That's enough.

204
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,199
I remember

205
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,520
someone likes something

206
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:30,839
over there.

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,439
I'll go find it.

208
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,959
Wait,

209
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,400
who likes what?

210
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,719
The birthday boy can eat

211
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,559
whatever he wants.

212
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,760
By the way,

213
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,240
did you

214
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,400
get in touch with Xiaoning?

215
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,160
Right, right,

216
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,760
my bad.

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,400
I'll call her now.

218
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,559
So much food.

219
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,240
Hello, Li Xiang?

220
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,559
Where are you?

221
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:50,959
Listen,

222
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:52,160
we're about to go to

223
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,559
Mr. Ji's place for his birthday.

224
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,400
It's a great chance

225
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,000
to get to know

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,839
our boss.

227
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,600
Share your location

228
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,400
when I arrive.

229
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,640
Just send

230
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,760
me the location,

231
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,480
I can find it.

232
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
Are you already there?

233
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,120
Not yet.

234
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:06,880
We'll be there

235
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,559
in about ten minutes.

236
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:09,160
Okay,

237
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,000
see you soon.

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Ms. Rao,

239
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,160
you're late.

240
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:29,760
Here,

241
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:30,319
help me with this.

242
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:33,679
Wait,

243
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,360
Yes.

244
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:35,679
just hold it for a moment.

245
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:37,120
Even if you're on the phone,

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,719
you can still

247
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,600
help me carry things.

248
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:53,959
And

249
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:54,799
those in front...

250
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,280
I'm telling you all.

251
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,120
Let's hurry up.

252
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,719
Why are you

253
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:58,839
in such a rush?

254
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,360
Tired, everyone?

255
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:02,199
Not too bad.

256
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,039
Good news,

257
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:04,600
we're almost there.

258
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,679
But seeing you all so tired,

259
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,400
let's rest a bit.

260
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,400
Let me tell you

261
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,000
about this wall.

262
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,480
In my neighborhood,

263
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,600
many retirees live here.

264
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,039
Look at this wall,

265
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,439
they built it themselves.

266
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,160
Every brick is eco-friendly,

267
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
insulated, and heat-resistant.

268
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,719
-And... -Boss,

269
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,959
let's talk about it later.

270
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,160
What do you mean later?

271
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,480
I was just explaining these bricks.

272
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,360
Look...

273
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,360
Don't worry,

274
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,079
let's wait for the others.

275
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:26,760
No, let's keep moving.

276
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:28,160
It's fine.

277
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,799
It's pretty convenient

278
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,480
living close to work.

279
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,480
This way.

280
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,839
Please enter unlock info.

281
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Unlock failed.

282
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,120
Please enter unlock info.

283
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:02,400
Boss,

284
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,799
this is a fingerprint lock.

285
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:07,679
My hand's a bit damp.

286
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,160
Unlocked.

287
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,520
Go ahead.

288
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,919
Boss,

289
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,520
where's your bathroom?

290
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,480
Right next door.

291
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,240
-All right. -Go ahead.

292
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,400
I'll go then.

293
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,799
Don't rush.

294
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,480
Let me get you slippers.

295
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,480
I'm in the room.

296
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,600
Cover me.

297
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,679
Boss.

298
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:57,959
I'm here.

299
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,959
What's going on?

300
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,360
What's up, Fanggang?

301
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,120
What are you talking about?

302
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,679
Are you dating someone?

303
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,839
Why do you ask?

304
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,679
I found a hair

305
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,719
in the bathroom.

306
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,160
The length and color

307
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,120
are definitely not yours.

308
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,719
It

309
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,880
looks like Xiaoning's.

310
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
What Xiaoning?

311
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,120
What are you talking about?

312
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,919
There must be someone.

313
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,120
Mr. Zhao,

314
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:28,799
why are you

315
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,520
so nosy?

316
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,199
Do you think Mr. Ji

317
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,039
is like you,

318
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,000
single dog?

319
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,919
It's normal for him to have a partner.

320
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,520
How am I single dog?

321
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,160
Before Mr. Ji arrived,

322
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,280
between me,

323
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,719
Xu Li, and Li Xiang,

324
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,719
I was considered

325
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,600
the face of our department.

326
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,079
Yeah,

327
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,039
and that almost

328
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:49,559
brought down

329
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,400
our department.

330
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,039
What?

331
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:53,160
Do you two really think

332
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,959
he was the face

333
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:54,880
of the department?

334
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,240
Look,

335
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,079
boss, sorry for

336
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,400
dropping by

337
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,480
unannounced.

338
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,719
Did we interrupt you?

339
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,400
Should we

340
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:11,880
invite your girlfriend

341
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,559
to join us?

342
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,439
We're...

343
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,240
you know,

344
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:21,760
in a complicated

345
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,120
situation right now.

346
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,919
Complicated?

347
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,240
Maybe...

348
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:30,480
Okay,

349
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,559
got it.

350
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:32,959
Mr. Ji,

351
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,039
the company

352
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
is cracking down on personal conduct.

353
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,079
Be careful.

354
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,719
Where's Xiaoning?

355
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,400
Did she get lost?

356
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:43,199
Maybe.

357
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,760
No, I called her

358
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,880
several times from the supermarket,

359
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,280
but she still isn't here.

360
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,520
Your efficiency is questionable.

361
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,120
Let me call her.

362
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:50,319
Then,

363
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,120
go ahead.

364
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,120
You're really nosy.

365
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,039
You can't

366
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,240
stay idle, can you?

367
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,719
If she's not here, I need to find her.

368
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,280
Let's play some music, lighten the mood.

369
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,160
How about

370
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,600
we have dinner

371
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,760
on the terrace?

372
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,439
There's a spot

373
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:08,360
up there

374
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,559
where we can set up.

375
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,240
Sounds good.

376
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,880
Okay.

377
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,719
You have a terrace?

378
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,120
Zhao Fanggang,

379
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,439
open the red wine bottle for me.

380
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:13,919
I'll need it

381
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,959
when I go up.

382
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,120
Am I your servant

383
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,039
or your butler?

384
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:21,719
It's up and to the left.

385
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:23,520
Fanggang,

386
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm almost there,

387
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,079
about ten minutes.

388
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,760
Boss,

389
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:30,839
let me handle it.

390
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:31,719
Okay.

391
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:32,880
Then,

392
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,679
I'll go change.

393
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,280
All right.

394
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,679
You go first.

395
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:35,799
Can't you help me with this?

396
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
You're really ungrateful.

397
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,360
Where is she?

398
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,600
Come out,

399
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,320
they've all gone upstairs.

400
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,120
My...

401
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,320
my legs are numb.

402
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,800
Let me massage them for you.

403
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:47,840
No.

404
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,040
The more you touch, the more it hurts.

405
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,239
Annoying.

406
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,959
Boss,

407
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,719
here you are.

408
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,479
What's up?

409
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:03,519
Xiaoning texted

410
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,519
that she'll be here in ten minutes.

411
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,840
Let's go downstairs to wait for her.

412
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,880
We'll welcome

413
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,999
her majesty

414
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:13,880
at doorstep.

415
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,919
All right.

416
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,279
Go change first.

417
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,600
Why are you back again?

418
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,840
You guys go ahead.

419
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,400
Mr. Ji and I will wait for Xiaoning.

420
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:08,919
Boss,

421
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,199
is there anyone else in your house

422
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:10,959
besides us?

423
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,640
Of course not.

424
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,040
I just saw

425
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,279
a shadow flash by.

426
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:16,719
Let me check.

427
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:20,919
There's no one.

428
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,840
You're just being paranoid.

429
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,600
Am I?

430
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:25,320
I'm only in my thirties,

431
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,360
my eyesight can't be that bad.

432
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:39,400
Mr. Ji.

433
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,080
Fanggang,

434
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,840
sorry,

435
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,479
I'm late.

436
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,400
No worries, come in.

437
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,320
Well,

438
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,479
you're doing hot pot today,

439
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,880
so I'll help out more.

440
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,279
Fanggang, can I help you?

441
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,239
No,

442
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,279
I've got this.

443
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,479
We can handle it.

444
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:03,360
You can see

445
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,279
if our boss needs any help.

446
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:05,959
Sure.

447
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,439
Help me cut this.

448
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,199
Leave it to me.

449
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,360
Need help?

450
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,279
Roll up my sleeves for me.

451
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,360
Sure.

452
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
My hands are all messy.

453
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,400
Good,

454
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:16,959
here.

455
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,160
Boss,

456
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:29,439
I've prepped

457
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,320
most of the veggies.

458
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,719
If in short,

459
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,320
I'll cut more.

460
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:33,759
Great.

461
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:34,840
Well,

462
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,239
it's time

463
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:35,959
to eat.

464
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:36,199
Okay.

465
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,080
Let me take that.

466
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,519
Boss,

467
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,040
here,

468
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:40,880
try this.

469
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,439
I can serve myself.

470
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,439
Let me get you some veggies.

471
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:43,840
Well,

472
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:44,320
Mr. Ji,

473
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,959
let me toast to you.

474
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:47,840
Sit down.

475
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:48,519
All right.

476
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:49,840
Since you

477
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,719
joined the company,

478
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,840
our section one's business

479
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,560
has been booming.

480
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,080
True.

481
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:54,840
I was

482
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,120
immature before.

483
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:57,279
I hope

484
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,919
you won't

485
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,360
take it to heart.

486
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,400
Cheers.

487
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:03,800
It's all in the past,

488
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:04,719
don't worry about it.

489
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:06,999
Li Xiang,

490
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,239
you're being too formal.

491
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,279
Calling him Mr. Ji all the time.

492
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,479
Boss,

493
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,320
here,

494
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,120
let me toast to you.

495
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,400
Drink it yourself.

496
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,040
Hey,

497
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,959
stop teasing.

498
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,719
See,

499
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,239
once you get to know each other,

500
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,519
you can joke around.

501
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,959
Let's all toast

502
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:26,919
to the boss

503
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,279
and start calling

504
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,800
him boss.

505
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:29,239
Here,

506
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:29,999
boss,

507
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,919
let me toast to you.

508
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,959
Wishing you reach new heights.

509
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:33,519
Okay.

510
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,600
Mr. Ji...

511
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:35,320
I mean,

512
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,800
boss, under your leadership,

513
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,880
our section one

514
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,120
will thrive.

515
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,040
-Good. -Well said.

516
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,800
Boss, though I'm not drinking,

517
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,759
my toast is heartfelt.

518
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,600
Boss,

519
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,080
may you achieve your goal of a billion.

520
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,160
All right.

521
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:49,679
Xiaoning, your turn.

522
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,239
Mr. Ji,

523
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:51,959
happy birthday.

524
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,919
Thank you for your care

525
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,679
and understanding.

526
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,479
Thanks for

527
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,239
your

528
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,880
genuine wishes, Xiaoning.

529
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:01,880
Let's keep

530
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:02,840
working together.

531
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,679
Cheers.

532
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,719
Cheers.

533
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,400
Everyone.

534
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,800
Cheers.

535
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,800
Bottoms up.

536
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:14,800
Boss,

537
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,479
you can

538
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,919
take it slow.

539
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,519
Our section one

540
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,519
is like a big family,

541
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,959
We make

542
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,080
money together,

543
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:25,759
we face

544
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:26,759
challenges together.

545
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:27,999
And we introduce

546
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,080
dating partners

547
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:29,800
to each other.

548
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
You just

549
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,199
want free

550
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,600
matchmaking services.

551
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,679
So what?

552
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:37,080
I'm not getting any younger.

553
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,840
Wanting to get married is normal.

554
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,479
Not everyone is like you,

555
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,439
playing around.

556
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,239
Changing partners every day.

557
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,279
Besides,

558
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,840
being a family

559
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,160
means supporting each other,

560
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,919
not just talking about it.

561
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,400
Yes.

562
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,800
Right?

563
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,320
Xiaoning,

564
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,320
you broke up with the guy

565
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,880
who sent you flowers?

566
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,679
No, I...

567
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,400
Let me

568
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,600
introduce you

569
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,239
to someone new.

570
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,279
No need.

571
00:22:58,959 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm not

572
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,919
looking to date now.

573
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,880
Got a new suitor?

574
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:03,679
No,

575
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,400
just focusing

576
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,880
on my exams.

577
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,320
Work is my priority.

578
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,320
Well, you know...

579
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,239
Saying too much is harassment.

580
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,239
I think Xiaoning is

581
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:13,840
doing the right thing.

582
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,759
I heard

583
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,439
Mr. Ji

584
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,880
just applied to add new staff

585
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:19,999
to our section one.

586
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:20,959
A new person

587
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,360
is joining next week.

588
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:23,320
Xiaoning,

589
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,519
you must do harder.

590
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,759
Don't let the

591
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,800
latecomer get ahead.

592
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:34,479
What were you talking about?

593
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Why so serious?

594
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,519
Just talking about what we're gonna play.

595
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,279
Right!

596
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,999
PS5.

597
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,880
Uno.

598
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,959
Or Legends of the Three Kingdoms.

599
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes.

600
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,360
I don't have any of those.

601
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,959
Does it mean we have

602
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:46,959
to play Truth or Dare?

603
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,600
No way.

604
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,040
How about checkers?

605
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,040
I have checkers.

606
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,160
Good idea!

607
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,600
Yeah!

608
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,320
Okay, I'll get it for you.

609
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,679
No, I'll get it.

610
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,519
Where is it?

611
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,919
It's in the room across from the stairs.

612
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,400
Okay.

613
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,080
It may take your time.

614
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,759
That's okay.

615
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,560
Be quick.

616
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,479
I ate too fast.

617
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,679
Just one small client.

618
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
It's not your fault.

619
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:19,640
Sir.

620
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,519
If you say so.

621
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:21,679
This might work.

622
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,519
I can eat more.

623
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,400
What?

624
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:27,600
What's wrong?

625
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,999
I thought you got checkers.

626
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,080
I didn't open it to check.

627
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,840
Sorry I got the wrong box.

628
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,199
Since we've got it,

629
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,439
let's take a look.

630
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,679
This doll is so cute.

631
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,640
Isn't it?

632
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,439
Cute little doll.

633
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,239
So pretty!

634
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,439
So pretty!

635
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,040
I didn't realize you can be so romantic.

636
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,519
"Your smile is like

637
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,999
sunshine to me.

638
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:57,719
Hope we have more stories

639
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,360
to tell in the future."

640
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,719
Good words.

641
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,160
Here.

642
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,120
Let's toast to

643
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,320
the Heather.

644
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,279
Okay.

645
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,160
Let's toast.

646
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:07,719
To the Heather.

647
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:08,199
Here.

648
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,400
Were you in relationship when

649
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,199
you were in college?

650
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,320
No.

651
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,679
Was there someone you into?

652
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,360
Not even one girl

653
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,040
in your heart?

654
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,080
Of course there was.

655
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,120
Mr. Ji is so romantic.

656
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,279
He still has that doll

657
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,719
after all these years.

658
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,519
Yeah.

659
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,040
What's that phrase?

660
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,840
The phrase you said at the toast.

661
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
"The Heather".

662
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,560
The girl must be

663
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,999
"the one" to Mr. Ji.

664
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,080
You don't know men.

665
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,199
When a man can't get it,

666
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:53,759
he misses it.

667
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,040
When he gets it, he won't cherish it anymore.

668
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,400
Jerk.

669
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,479
I don't think so.

670
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,600
Judging by his character,

671
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,840
I'm sure he'd be very affectionate

672
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,199
if he was

673
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,040
with that girl.

674
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Ling Weiyi wants to see me.

675
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:05,560
I'll be home later.

676
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,519
You're right.

677
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,479
Your judgment is...

678
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:09,560
Hello?

679
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,679
Yes.

680
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,040
See the location I sent you?

681
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,959
Go all the way in,

682
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:13,880
and you'll find me.

683
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:16,439
Ms. Rao.

684
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,160
The little boyfriend from last time?

685
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,560
Which time?

686
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,040
The blind date.

687
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,679
This time is just

688
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,199
a friend.

689
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,800
A friend.

690
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,759
Don't wanna be responsible for relationship.

691
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,919
You're not...

692
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,560
Not scum but dust.

693
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,640
Mr. Zhao.

694
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,360
Since you're so sorry for them,

695
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,800
I really want to know

696
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,279
if you're envying

697
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:43,800
them,

698
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,160
or you're envying me.

699
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,400
It's alright, Fanggang.

700
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,080
Jing won this one.

701
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,160
Have another round next time.

702
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:49,840
Yeah.

703
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:50,400
Jing.

704
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:52,919
Here you are.

705
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,239
Let me introduce.

706
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,040
They're my coworkers.

707
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:57,360
Well,

708
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,279
we're off now.

709
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,239
I drank today.

710
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,519
You'll drive.

711
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:01,880
Okay.

712
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,080
Okay.

713
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:03,759
He's just average-looking.

714
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:04,999
I think he's handsome.

715
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,239
Better than the previous one.

716
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:09,800
Hello?

717
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:11,040
Okay.

718
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,519
I'm on my way.

719
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,640
My ride's here.

720
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,400
Who'll come with me?

721
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,120
I'll give you a lift.

722
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,239
-We'll grab a cab. -What about Xiaoning?

723
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,199
My cab is almost here.

724
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:18,840
Let's go.

725
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:19,679
Okay.

726
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,439
Let's go.

727
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,600
Hello, Ling Weiyi.

728
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:22,919
Where are you?

729
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,679
It's not the first time I've learned

730
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,719
he has someone before.

731
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
I have an ex.

732
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,600
I'm not

733
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,080
a double-standard.

734
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,999
I don't mind he having first love

735
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,439
while I have an ex.

736
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,040
But an ex is different from

737
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,919
"a Heather".

738
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,479
What is it? It's a love

739
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,400
out of reach yet keeps you craving.

740
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,999
We've been together for a couple months.

741
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,120
He still saves the gift

742
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,400
for this girl.

743
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,479
How much and special

744
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,479
this girl

745
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,519
means to him.

746
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,239
Look at your

747
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,120
jealous and

748
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,400
sulky face.

749
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,160
People would think you must

750
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,400
love him so dearly.

751
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,320
What the matter with you?

752
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:07,600
Me?

753
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,840
You were checking your phone all the time.

754
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,279
You weren't listening to me.

755
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,600
Who are you messaging?

756
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,719
Look at your radiant face.

757
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:15,239
There must be someone,

758
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,560
and you don't share with me.

759
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,120
Spit it out.

760
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,239
Who's that man?

761
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,120
You know who he is.

762
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:25,759
Qi Yu?

763
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,560
You're back together?

764
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,759
Since when?

765
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,999
Just two days ago.

766
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:43,679
I'm done.

767
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:47,439
Thank you.

768
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,719
I told you

769
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,239
you didn't have to make the trip.

770
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,479
I could call a repairman.

771
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:52,880
I know.

772
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,679
I'm a volunteer.

773
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,400
The repairman isn't

774
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,320
always on time.

775
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:04,360
Besides, you were alone.

776
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:04,959
I could be worried.

777
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,199
No.

778
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:06,999
I mean,

779
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:08,120
it's not safe for a girl alone at night.

780
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,880
How about

781
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,199
I buy you dinner.

782
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,439
No, thanks.

783
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:15,519
I mean,

784
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,239
I don't like to owe people favors.

785
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:17,840
You know.

786
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:18,959
I know.

787
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,719
I'm sweating all over.

788
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,320
I'd like to take a shower

789
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
before lights out in the dorm.

790
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,719
If you really

791
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,320
want to take a shower,

792
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,679
You can do it on the first floor.

793
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:30,519
I'm on the second floor.

794
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,160
Take a shower here?

795
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,040
Better not.

796
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,120
It's not convenient when you are here.

797
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,199
That's it.

798
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,439
I'll go now.

799
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:51,600
And

800
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,959
remember to lock the door

801
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,759
before you go to bed.

802
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,479
I'm taking the trash away.

803
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:03,880
Okay.

804
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,800
Hello?

805
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,120
Is that the security department?

806
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:19,759
Yes.

807
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,040
I'm Ling Weiyi from the front desk.

808
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,199
I'd like to ask,

809
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,479
is staff dorm

810
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,600
near the building

811
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,239
of workplace?

812
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,519
Yes.

813
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,840
Could you please send me

814
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:30,959
the address of the dorm?

815
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:10,800
You're the girl from

816
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,239
the front desk.

817
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,400
What are you doing here?

818
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,479
I'm looking for Qi Yu.

819
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,600
Does he live here?

820
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,360
He's in the shower.

821
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,199
Come in and wait.

822
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,999
Ma,

823
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,239
have you eaten yet?

824
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,759
Weiyi?

825
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:47,840
Why are you here?

826
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,840
You left your ID at my house.

827
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,880
I'm here to bring it to you.

828
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,439
You could have called me

829
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,479
to pick it up.

830
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,479
It's not safe to walk alone

831
00:31:58,479 --> 00:31:59,120
at night.

832
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,279
Make yourself at home.

833
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:06,999
Have a drink.

834
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,120
No, thank you.

835
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,640
So this is where you live?

836
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,999
You mean dorm?

837
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,959
It's not bad.

838
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,840
Though it's small,

839
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,239
it's really cozy.

840
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,479
The closets.

841
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,880
I bought it

842
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,160
from a roommate who had left the city.

843
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:26,160
Do you know how old is it?

844
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:27,320
Ten years!

845
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:28,719
But it's still

846
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:29,600
sturdy and durable.

847
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:31,479
And

848
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,759
this little table lamp by the bed.

849
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,199
The light of phone screen won't be

850
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,040
harsh with the lamp on.

851
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:36,279
Here.

852
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,560
This

853
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,759
bed table.

854
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,279
It's really stable on the bed

855
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,279
when I eat here.

856
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:44,800
Isn't it simple?

857
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,080
I have another house

858
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,239
near your workplace.

859
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,959
You can stay there for now.

860
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,360
It'll make it easier for you

861
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,479
to get to and from work.

862
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,400
I really don't need it.

863
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,519
Living here and working at the bank

864
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,519
are both temporary.

865
00:32:58,919 --> 00:32:59,439
"Temporary"?

866
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,439
What do you mean?

867
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,360
Actually, I was planning to take

868
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,279
the civil service exam again

869
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,199
before I went back to Xing City.

870
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,519
The bank's job

871
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,759
is to make ends meet.

872
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,199
The president knows it.

873
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,959
He said I'm good in many ways.

874
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,800
So he recommended that

875
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,080
I take the police exam.

876
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,840
I've been preparing.

877
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,320
But I've heard that

878
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,080
the exams are difficult.

879
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:19,999
Why do you have to

880
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:20,800
work so hard?

881
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:22,360
It's not hard for me.

882
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,759
That sand bottle

883
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,279
was my first

884
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,199
gift to him

885
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,400
when we first got together.

886
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,719
Qi Yu is usually

887
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,840
insensitive.

888
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:35,840
He'd been back home

889
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,560
for so long.

890
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,519
I thought he'd lost it

891
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,239
a long time ago.

892
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,519
I didn't realize he had it all the time.

893
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:44,880
Think about it.

894
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,120
He has a car, a house

895
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,479
and a stable job

896
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,679
in his hometown.

897
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:50,040
He could have lived comfortably there.

898
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,999
But now he's here

899
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:52,719
for me.

900
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:57,239
I went to see his dormitory.

901
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,120
I felt sorry for him.

902
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,400
But he's still

903
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,840
positive.

904
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:04,959
I can tell

905
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,320
he's serious about

906
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,120
our relationship.

907
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,759
He's really given a lot.

908
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,239
Yeah.

909
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:12,800
Lu Sijing told me many times

910
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,560
that he

911
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
need to look up to him.

912
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,160
But honestly,

913
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,040
they're not

914
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,239
the same kind at all.

915
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,279
They're different.

916
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,719
In what way?

917
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,040
Qi Yu

918
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,160
will put your needs

919
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,000
first.

920
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,080
Your needs

921
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:27,920
paramount

922
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,960
at all times.

923
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,920
Honestly,

924
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,719
how many people

925
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,839
can do that nowadays?

926
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,199
He deserves to be loved.

927
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:34,960
I also deserve to be loved!

928
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:35,759
Of course.

929
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,520
Lu Sijing

930
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,719
can't match Qi Yu.

931
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,960
They're different

932
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,799
in the most important part.

933
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,359
That is, for you,

934
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,000
he has already been a history.

935
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:47,239
But Qi Yu and I

936
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,480
were just bickering.

937
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:51,120
We never got to the point

938
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,239
of breaking it off.

939
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,679
Yeah.

940
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,080
You deserve the best.

941
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,759
I wish you two

942
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,120
the best of luck

943
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,799
in your relationship,

944
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,480
and the best life.

945
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,560
I don't expect the best life.

946
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,960
I just hope

947
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,160
our relationship

948
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,440
can be sweet,

949
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,080
like old times in college.

950
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,239
Unlocked.

951
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm back.

952
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,839
You're back so early.

953
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,000
I was thinking to pick you up

954
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,600
after the cleaning.

955
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,719
Why did Ling Weiyi

956
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:25,759
call you out?

957
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,440
She's back together with Qi Yu.

958
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,520
They get back together?

959
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,960
It's great.

960
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,520
Though I've only met him

961
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,359
a few times.

962
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,520
I think he's

963
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,359
an honest man.

964
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,080
What?

965
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,000
Something's on your mind?

966
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,600
Ji Yuheng.

967
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:46,080
Can,

968
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,480
can I ask you something?

969
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,799
Yeah.

970
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,319
Sure.

971
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,319
You didn't tell me

972
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,319
your birthday.

973
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:56,679
Is it because

974
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,399
there's someone

975
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,960
you'd rather spend your birthday with?

976
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,080
Is it really bothering you?

977
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,199
In fact, very few people

978
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,520
know my birthday

979
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:06,640
except my mom and HR.

980
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,600
And I'm not used to

981
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,560
having birthday party.

982
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,120
In the old days,

983
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,120
my parents

984
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,399
could still be with me

985
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,839
for a happy birthday.

986
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,120
But after

987
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,319
my mom got sick,

988
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:17,640
I rarely had birthdays.

989
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:19,279
If that's what you

990
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,080
care about,

991
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,839
we'll spend my birthday

992
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,160
together from now on,

993
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:26,120
okay?

994
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:28,560
I never thought to

995
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,920
ask him his birthday.

996
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,040
I thought we were good enough.

997
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,160
Now I know,

998
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,359
there's still a distance.

999
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,239
What are you thinking?

1000
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,199
I'm thinking

1001
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,440
the exams are coming up

1002
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,520
at the end of the month.

1003
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,960
I should go and study.

1004
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,520
We were

1005
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:49,600
in a hurry today.

1006
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,679
I didn't prepare a present for you.

1007
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,120
Is there anything you want

1008
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,960
for your birthday?

1009
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:55,879
Can I

1010
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:56,879
keep it in mind,

1011
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,440
and you can give me later

1012
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,239
when I have ideas.

1013
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:00,560
Okay.

1014
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,960
There's been so much

1015
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,600
between us.

1016
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,560
Are you still

1017
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,960
harboring the girl out of reach?

1018
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
You've given me

1019
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:29,399
the gift I've been longing for

1020
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,160
all these years.

1021
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,040
This way.

1022
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,199
You're new here.

1023
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,160
You may need to

1024
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,279
readjust in many ways.

1025
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,520
Section 1 and 2

1026
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,560
are on the same floor.

1027
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:09,040
This is the office

1028
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,160
of our Section 1.

1029
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,040
Guys.

1030
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,759
Attention, please.

1031
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,920
Hold on.

1032
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:16,960
There's a new

1033
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,120
personnel change.

1034
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,080
Let me introduce.

1035
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,920
This is

1036
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:22,799
Tang Yuhui.

1037
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,839
She'll be one of us

1038
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,440
as a member of Section 1 of BDD.

1039
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,040
Tang.

1040
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,960
Why don't you introduce

1041
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,080
yourself to everyone?

1042
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:30,600
Okay.

1043
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,359
Good morning.

1044
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,799
I'm Tang Yuhui.

1045
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:36,600
I used to be a lobby manager.

1046
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:37,839
I'm honored

1047
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,279
to be in Section 1.

1048
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,080
And I hope that

1049
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,279
I can give a boost

1050
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,120
to the section.

1051
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,600
It's almost the end of the year.

1052
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:48,719
The bank's deposit target

1053
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,679
for our department

1054
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,759
is still not being met.

1055
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,239
Let's work together to meet the target

1056
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,679
before the New Year.

1057
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:55,440
I'll leave you to your work.

1058
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:56,199
Okay.

1059
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,560
Yuheng,

1060
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,480
I haven't given you this yet.

1061
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:09,960
Come to my office.

1062
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,799
I'm on my way.

1063
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,359
Fanggang.

1064
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,759
I got news.

1065
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:26,759
What news?

1066
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,000
The new girl, Tang Yuhui,

1067
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,000
said to have been

1068
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:31,719
in the same college with Mr. Ji.

1069
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,080
I noticed she kept

1070
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,239
her eyes on Mr. Ji.

1071
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,239
I know from years of experience that

1072
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,759
there's something between them.

1073
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,839
What thing?

1074
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,399
I've heard that

1075
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,040
Tang Yuhui's father is

1076
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,279
the boss of the largest

1077
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,399
listed company in the city.

1078
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,080
He's got business with Dairui.

1079
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,199
That's odd.

1080
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,000
You see,

1081
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,960
this Tang Yuhui is

1082
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:53,480
highly educated,

1083
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,799
has a dad in high place,

1084
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,319
and she's pretty.

1085
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,520
She can go to

1086
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,480
any of Dairui's departments.

1087
00:40:58,839 --> 00:40:59,480
Why does she have to

1088
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,160
come to our Section 1

1089
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:02,239
instead of Section 2?

1090
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:03,440
What's your point?

1091
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,080
You mean Section 2 is better than us?

1092
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,480
Absolutely not.

1093
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,679
Tang, with your ability

1094
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,719
and resources,

1095
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,319
you can go to

1096
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:14,080
a better department.

1097
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,319
Why do you want to come here?

1098
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,319
I think BDD

1099
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,399
has potential.

1100
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:21,600
If HQ is about to

1101
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,799
set up a branch,

1102
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,520
they'll definitely

1103
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,960
pick someone from here.

1104
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,239
I want to try.

1105
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,120
You're far-sighted.

1106
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,359
Whether you're using

1107
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,359
this place as

1108
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,399
a springboard or not,

1109
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,279
as long as you're here,

1110
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:36,920
you need to do your best.

1111
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:37,600
Okay.

1112
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:39,560
The old friends from college.

1113
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,480
Is she the girl

1114
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,520
who's "out of reach"?

1115
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,799
The doll!

1116
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,920
You're right!

1117
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,799
Tang Yuhui came here

1118
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,239
just for Mr. ji...

1119
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,160
Her hair looks

1120
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,319
exactly like that doll's.

1121
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,440
Dairui

1122
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,839
doesn't support office romances.

1123
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,920
Mr. Ji must know that.

1124
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,600
Rules can also be discarded

1125
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,399
in the face of resources and profit.

1126
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,679
It's their privilege.

1127
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:12,920
I thought I could be her mentor.

1128
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:16,920
Xu Li.

1129
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:18,000
You got a mirror?

1130
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:18,839
No.

1131
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,839
I can give you one.

1132
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,000
Great.

1133
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,600
To see who you really are.

1134
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:24,679
To her, Mr. Ji is somebody.

1135
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,040
And you're nobody.

1136
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,560
You rhymed!

1137
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,080
So you're a rapper?

1138
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,199
Exactly.

1139
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,199
Yuheng.

1140
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,359
Can Ms. Rao

1141
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,199
be my mentor?

1142
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,520
I heard about it

1143
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,480
back in the lobby that

1144
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,560
she has the best track record.

1145
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,960
She is Tu Xiaoning's mentor.

1146
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,199
You can take Mr. Xu.

1147
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,920
But Xiaoning worked as an intern

1148
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,839
for 3 years in the lobby.

1149
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,160
I don't think she has a chance

1150
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,440
to be a permanent employee.

1151
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,960
Mr. Xu seems to be

1152
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,000
easy-going.

1153
00:42:58,279 --> 00:42:59,399
Why don't she go to Mr. Xu?

1154
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,920
That may be easier for her.

1155
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,319
She has her own advantages.

1156
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,759
There's a comprehensive evaluation that

1157
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:06,839
will determine whether she can make it.

1158
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:08,359
If you don't want

1159
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:09,359
to take Mr. Xu,

1160
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,920
You can choose Mr. Zhao.

1161
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,480
He can teach you.

1162
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,279
I'll choose Mr. Xu.

1163
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,399
I trust you can choose

1164
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,679
the best mentor for me.

1165
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,239
If you have no other questions,

1166
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:22,920
go to work.

1167
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,480
Okay.

1168
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,080
Yuheng.

1169
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,520
In fact, I came here

1170
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:40,480
not just because of

1171
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,719
its potential.

1172
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:19,000
Is that a girl?

1173
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
You like her?

1174
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,520
It's

1175
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,960
her birthday soon.
