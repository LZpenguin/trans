English subtitles are available

00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,120
You Are My Secret EP09

3
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,360
We gotta go.

4
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:47,879
Xiaoning,

5
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,000
wait a minute.

6
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,759
Sijing has something to tell you.

7
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,840
I got something really crucial to get to.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,920
We'll talk tomorrow.

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,239
Xiaoning!

10
00:01:58,679 --> 00:01:59,679
I know you still don't forgive me.

11
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,239
You don't accept my flowers

12
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,039
or pick up my calls.

13
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:02,840
I have no choice but to come here.

14
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,679
What now?

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,280
Xiaoning,

16
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,479
what happened

17
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,720
was my fault.

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,879
Can you give me another chance?

20
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,359
We'd been together 7 years.

21
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,479
I don't believe

22
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,319
you've put me behind you.

23
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:31,879
I haven't.

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,240
I knew it.

25
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:36,240
We shared

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,599
7 years of memory.

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,479
Do you remember

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,960
I'd go with you to your major courses,

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,079
we'd make notes

30
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,240
and ask questions?

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,560
The first time

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
you visited our specimen room,

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,359
you got so scared that you couldn't sleep.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,759
You called me at mid night,

35
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:49,560
said you wanna go for a run.

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,919
In the senior year...

37
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,680
Lu Sijing!

38
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,240
What's the point raking up the past?

39
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,919
I said I haven't forgotten

40
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,039
'cause that's my youth years.

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,479
I'd never forget them.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,720
But I don't love you any more.

43
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,199
I don't

44
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,079
feel anything for you.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,039
You...

46
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:09,879
don't love me any more.

47
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,879
Does it mean

48
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,680
you'll never

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,479
forgive me?

50
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,120
Does it matter

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,160
whether I forgive you or not?

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,039
Love and forgiveness

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,479
aren't the same thing.

54
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,280
It matters to me.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,160
You're in love with someone else.

56
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:48,079
Right?

57
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,560
That's my business.

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't you worry.

59
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,199
Let's go.

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,160
Xiaoning!

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm not giving up!

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm off.

63
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:18,560
Take care, Mr. Ji.

64
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:01,840
The flowers...

65
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,080
They're from him?

66
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,840
They are.

67
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,559
But I thought...

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,160
Throw them out.

69
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:13,880
I already did.

70
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,880
Pick up.

71
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,559
See what he wants.

72
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,280
Hello, Xiaoning.

73
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,239
I don't wanna give up on you.

74
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,919
It was all my fault.

75
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,919
I'm so sorry.

76
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,720
Please give me a second chance.

77
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:09,760
Xiaoning,

78
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,999
are you listening?

79
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:45,679
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,080
Don't be bothered

81
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,880
by what he said.

82
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,559
Okay?

83
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,999
The bids Mr. Shen made

84
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,080
were ingenious.

85
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,679
Pushed the bidding

86
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,599
price right up

87
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,760
and covered

88
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,160
the principal of the bad loan debt.

89
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:39,239
Well done, Zhao,

90
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,999
turning a bad loan into something good.

91
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,840
The award

92
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,119
is well deserved!

93
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:44,760
Xu Li,

94
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,760
low-key! Keep it in mind!

95
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
Yeah, low-key, I know.

96
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,679
Ms. Rao.

97
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,840
Made all the way here, huh?

98
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,999
Aren't you gonna applaud me?

99
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:54,799
Sure.

100
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:55,880
Special applause

101
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,239
to the special you.

102
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,320
Alright, done. Now go back.

103
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,760
You're giving me a headache hovering here.

104
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,999
Won't kill you to sit down.

105
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,720
It will kill me.

106
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,720
How can I sit

107
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,119
at such a special moment?

108
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,039
Kill you? Piece of cake.

109
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,160
Xiaoning, go open that window

110
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
for Mr. Zhao.

111
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,080
He said sitting will kill him.

112
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,280
Let him jump to his death then.

113
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,760
I think that window's jammed.

114
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:16,640
Oh, is it?

115
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,320
See?

116
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,400
Xiaoning works

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,080
for me sometime now.

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,439
But the rest of them

119
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,200
work.

120
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,840
Are they?

121
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,160
That hurts.

122
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,720
Women, huh.

123
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,999
Go back to your seat.

124
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:30,559
Mr. Ji.

125
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,479
Try to be

126
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,679
professional at work.

127
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,720
Sorry, sir.

128
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,679
Mr. Ji.

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,439
What is it?

130
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,520
Sir,

131
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,160
I found some premium

132
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,199
clients on my way

133
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,799
back from the Park.

134
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,959
Was gonna talk to you about it.

135
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,679
Let's talk in my office.

136
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,919
See?

137
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,880
Someone's switched allegiance.

138
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,199
Even Mr. Jiang couldn't tame him

139
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,000
when he's here.

140
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,839
Yet Mr. Ji did it.

141
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,199
He's got something, hasn't he?

142
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,400
It's...

143
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,360
You.

144
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:23,959
Come.

145
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,799
Get this out of here.

146
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,760
Such bad luck.

147
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,360
Chop chop.

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,319
Enough gloating.

149
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,400
"I have some clients"

150
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,640
"I need to talk to you about..."

151
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,079
Want some?

152
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:49,760
I'm good. Thanks.

153
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,480
Your ex?

154
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,280
He won't leave me alone.

155
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,360
Is that why

156
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:04,240
you're not picking up his calls?

157
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,360
You gotta remember

158
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,039
he's your ex,

159
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,520
but he's also your client.

160
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,360
Are you getting back together?

161
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,160
No.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
Then your conscience is clear.

163
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,400
You've done nothing wrong.

164
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,240
Plus,

165
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,160
you can't guarantee

166
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,400
you won't run into a client

167
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,039
who shares a

168
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,799
special relationship

169
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,679
with you.

170
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,880
Like your relatives.

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,799
exes,

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,480
or enemies.

173
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,520
What then?

174
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,520
You gonna hide from all of them?

175
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,760
What about your job then?

176
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,160
Hello?

177
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,160
Hi, Xiaoning.

178
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,400
the Medical Banking Card

179
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,480
service our hospital provides

180
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,000
is managed by your department, right?

181
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,039
There's been a hitch.

182
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:43,160
Patients who failed to pay

183
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,000
are causing trouble.

184
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,839
The president is pissed

185
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,799
and thinking to replace you.

186
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,120
So...

187
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,400
I see.

188
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,280
We'll be on our way.

189
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,039
We will sort it out.

190
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,039
Get ready.

191
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,199
We're going to Renji Hospital.

192
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,640
We've been notified.

193
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,679
We're on our way.

194
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,160
Bring the tech guy

195
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,839
along.

196
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay.

197
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,799
I'll bring some gift boxes too.

198
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,360
Have the tech unit fix the servers.

199
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,360
Wait a second.

200
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,000
Do what you do best

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,480
as a hall manager.

202
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,319
We've been waiting

203
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:21,360
over half an hour.

204
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,799
I can't get my medicine if I can't pay.

205
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:23,959
I only have four hours off work

206
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:24,719
to see a doctor.

207
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,679
Without my medicine,

208
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,679
how do I get back to work?

209
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,480
Right.

210
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,039
If words got out,

211
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,799
other banks would swoop in

212
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,520
for this deal.

213
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,160
They are

214
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,120
ruthless.

215
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,959
Listen, you must

216
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,719
handle this well.

217
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll talk to the president.

218
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,640
Okay.

219
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,120
Wait a minute!

220
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,319
Our transaction system...

221
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,280
What's going on?

222
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,240
Quiet!

223
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,799
Excuse me!

224
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,199
Quiet, everyone, please.

225
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,600
Can I say something?

226
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,919
Thank you.

227
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm

228
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,480
an employee from Dairui.

229
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,719
The hospital's system

230
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:54,760
is handled by our bank.

231
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,120
We're very sorry

232
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,959
this has happened.

233
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,839
My sincerest apologies.

234
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,280
We appreciate your understanding.

235
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,319
Our tech man

236
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,199
has confirmed that

237
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:02,959
15 minutes

238
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,919
at most,

239
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,799
the problem

240
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,480
can be fixed.

241
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,240
We've been waiting for ages.

242
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,120
Right, right.

243
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,559
We're very sorry.

244
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,959
As a token of our apology,

245
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:10,799
we're giving out

246
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,039
thermal cups.

247
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,559
We can

248
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
pass them around later.

249
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,240
Who wants that?

250
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,280
I need to pay

251
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,719
and go back to work.

252
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,120
How about this?

253
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,919
Give me

254
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,919
your prescriptions.

255
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,600
I'll give them to the pharmacy.

256
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,039
Once the system is back online

257
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
you can pay,

258
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,199
get your medicine and leave.

259
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,079
Will that work?

260
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Hurry then.

261
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:29,919
Okay. Thank you.

262
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,839
Hurry.

263
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:31,919
But I need to see a doctor.

264
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,959
Okay. Okay.

265
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,559
Thank you.

266
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,199
Thanks for your understanding.

267
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:34,719
Need a hand?

268
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:36,640
No.

269
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:36,959
Excuse me.

270
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:37,839
Are you the doctor

271
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,600
who saw me earlier?

272
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,439
Sure. Sure.

273
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,160
How do I take this medicine?

274
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,760
You can't take this.

275
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,160
This one.

276
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,039
Two times a day.

277
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,559
Ten hours in between.

278
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,120
Is that all?

279
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:44,000
Thank you, everyone.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,400
Take it with food,

281
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,079
to protect your stomach.

282
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,559
Okay.

283
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:45,919
But...

284
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,319
the doctor told me

285
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,679
there's no money in the personal account

286
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,280
of my medical card.

287
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,240
What does that mean?

288
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,120
You might need

289
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,039
to activate it.

290
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,160
Okay, thanks.

291
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,719
Here.

292
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,520
Don't worry.

293
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,120
There's one for everyone.

294
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,880
Come get it.

295
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,480
Excuse me.

296
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,199
Please prepare

297
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,439
these medicines.

298
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,240
They'll be collected when paid.

299
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,600
Okay.

300
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,400
Thanks.

301
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,039
Done.

302
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,959
Fixed?

303
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,439
Thank you so much.

304
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,760
Liu Xiaoqian.

305
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,559
It's mine.

306
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,000
Here.

307
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,280
Ma Qiang?

308
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,799
Here.

309
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,839
So?

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,640
How did it go?

311
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,880
I was a

312
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,360
hall manager for three years.

313
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,199
I can handle

314
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:09,199
a situation like this.

315
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,959
What about you, Jing?

316
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,839
I'm the

317
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,520
top woman of Section 1.

318
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,559
This is not my

319
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,799
first time handling a disturbance.

320
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:20,520
As my soldier,

321
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,160
you've done pretty well.

322
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,400
I heard

323
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,559
your ex

324
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,319
did you quite a favor.

325
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,679
Thank you for earlier.

326
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,039
You are welcome.

327
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,360
Um...

328
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,959
can I buy you a coffee?

329
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,039
Not that I want

330
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,839
something in return

331
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,839
'cause I did you a small favor.

332
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I just

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,839
need to talk to you.

334
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,039
It's almost time

335
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,000
to clock out.

336
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,240
I'll let you decide.

337
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,640
See you, Doctor Lu.

338
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,520
Bye, Jing.

339
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,839
Okay then.

340
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,039
I'll get changed.

341
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:14,240
See you downstairs in a bit.

342
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,199
Sorted?

343
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:22,880
Join me for dinner?

344
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,520
Maybe later.

345
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,839
I need to

346
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:31,880
talk to Lu Sijing.

347
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:37,919
Mom,

348
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,120
have you received the money

349
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,880
for this month?

350
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,360
Okay.

351
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,719
Yeah, I wired more.

352
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:44,959
Bye.

353
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,280
Ms. Rao.

354
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:50,719
Working yourself too hard, no?

355
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,360
Coming back here

356
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,600
out of office hours.

357
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:54,600
Getting some files.

358
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,919
Oh, right.

359
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,079
Congrats on rising

360
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,000
up to outstanding individual.

361
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,559
Are you...

362
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,000
complimenting me?

363
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,400
Did I hear it right?

364
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,679
See, I'm

365
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,760
getting goosebumps.

366
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,799
Well, I admit

367
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,280
you're not a nobody

368
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,199
when it comes to work,

369
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,079
but quite a

370
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,439
good match for me.

371
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:21,959
Congratulations.

372
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,120
Fine.

373
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:26,400
I'll take that as a

374
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,319
compliment too.

375
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,439
Thanks.

376
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:31,760
Thanks.

377
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,199
Black coffee with lemon.

378
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,959
No mayo in your sandwich.

379
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,079
Thanks.

380
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,160
You still remember.

381
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,919
I wasn't one

382
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,240
to remember things back then.

383
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:47,880
But coming back

384
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,559
and seeing you

385
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,240
is making everything

386
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,000
come flooding back.

387
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,039
Things you like,

388
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,000
and what kind of life

389
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,039
you want...

390
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,839
I only realize them now.

391
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
That's 'cause

392
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,039
you've realized your dream

393
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,120
of being a doctor.

394
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,160
So relationships have been

395
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,480
moved up in their importance.

396
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,360
Xiaoning,

397
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,400
I think you've misunderstood me.

398
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,160
I was all alone

399
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,079
studying abroad.

400
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,999
I was super stressed.

401
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,080
But it doesn't mean I didn't care.

402
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,919
Let's not

403
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,800
dredge up the past.

404
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,679
You know this.

405
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,199
The only way

406
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,479
for medical students to get in a

407
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,759
hospital is to get further qualifications.

408
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:41,919
I worked my ass off.

409
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,080
Finally a university

410
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,479
abroad was willing to admit me.

411
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,199
They had the most advance technology

412
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,160
and the research projects

413
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,880
I dreamed of doing.

414
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,880
I had to get

415
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,679
the best grades

416
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:51,800
if I wanna stay after graduation.

417
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
That was my only chance.

418
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,400
I know.

419
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:57,560
And I understand.

420
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,479
Now that

421
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,999
your dream has come true,

422
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,279
all your efforts

423
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,199
have paid off.

424
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:04,880
As an old classmate of yours,

425
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,999
I am glad for you.

426
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:11,800
Xiaoning,

427
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,080
I know

428
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm pestering you.

429
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,160
But I wanna try with you again.

430
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,560
Give me a chance,

431
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:23,840
will you?

432
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,640
I'm sorry,

433
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,560
but I can't.

434
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,600
There's no future

435
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,640
between us.

436
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,560
I came 'cause

437
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,719
I wanna express my gratitude

438
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,360
to you.

439
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,679
Thanks for being there for me for 7 years.

440
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,040
We shared so many beautiful memories.

441
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:51,199
I hope

442
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,479
we can part on peaceful terms.

443
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,439
I will

444
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,199
turn a new leaf in my life.

445
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,360
So will you.

446
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,640
But it's over

447
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,679
between us.

448
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,840
Do you understand what I'm saying?

449
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,320
Seems

450
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,679
I really screwed up

451
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,400
our future.

452
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,040
If I hadn't left

453
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,600
or if I had

454
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
come back earlier for you,

455
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,320
maybe

456
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,160
we would end differently.

457
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:28,519
Maybe.

458
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,679
No one

459
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,999
will keep

460
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,080
waiting forever.

461
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,519
Besides, I'm

462
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,640
in love with someone now.

463
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,040
Ji Yuheng.

464
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:42,640
Yes.

465
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,160
Office romance

466
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,800
isn't encouraged in our bank.

467
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,160
Not to mention we're in the same dept.

468
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,959
It's not convenient to say it out,

469
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,719
but I should

470
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,160
let you know sooner.

471
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,840
Sorry,

472
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,840
I gotta go.

473
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,959
Wish you

474
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:06,919
all the best.

475
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,160
Goodbye.

476
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:40,640
Goodbye.

477
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,519
What are you doing here?

478
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,519
I come to see my mom.

479
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,719
Finished?

480
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,679
Why do you look...

481
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,439
a little upset?

482
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,439
You know...

483
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:14,800
the old days

484
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,840
still surround me.

485
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,800
I can't tell you that

486
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,999
I've forgotten everything.

487
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,880
But please trust me,

488
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,519
I'll handle all well.

489
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,040
It's all over now.

490
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,999
Let's go see my mom.

491
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,360
OK.

492
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:33,600
Let's go.

493
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,279
Oh, enough!

494
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,360
Okay.

495
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,800
So much you ordered!

496
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,120
Didn't you have enough for dinner?

497
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,199
I didn't eat nothing at all.

498
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,880
I see.

499
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:06,759
That's good,

500
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:07,880
I'll go with you.

501
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:09,679
These three flavors

502
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,120
are all your favorites, right?

503
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,519
How did you know?

504
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,199
Were you secretly following me then?

505
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,679
You're the school hunk.

506
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,439
The girls

507
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,080
talked about you all the time.

508
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,719
It's hard not to follow you.

509
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,199
I remember

510
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:30,199
you're waiting for someone

511
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,160
at the entrance of my class,

512
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,080
but you turned around

513
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,719
and ran away immediately

514
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:36,519
after seeing me.

515
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,400
Was it possible that

516
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:40,679
you're waiting for me?

517
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:45,160
No, no.

518
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,080
I wasn't.

519
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,560
Then,

520
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,320
why did you run away?

521
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,519
Well... I was indeed waiting for you.

522
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,800
But I was asked to.

523
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,999
My classmate

524
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,199
wanted me

525
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,279
to send you a love letter.

526
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:00,640
Is it good?

527
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Are you happy with the delicious food?

528
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,519
What's the matter?

529
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,279
Why are you

530
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,439
so down today?

531
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,719
Mom can see it.

532
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,719
Because of me?

533
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:15,840
Nothing.

534
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,360
Don't just eat,

535
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,679
I'm talking to you.

536
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:22,439
What did I do to upset you?

537
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,959
I've been pondering a question.

538
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,360
We got married 'cause

539
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
we're compatible with each other.

540
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,120
What about now?

541
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,439
Is it still the same as before?

542
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,919
Now,

543
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:18,199
I think we're getting along

544
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:19,880
very well.

545
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,400
But...

546
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,919
Focus on the food.

547
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,199
Stop talking further.

548
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,919
Back to the school time,

549
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,040
many girls

550
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,120
would've been

551
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,160
waiting on this street,

552
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,560
just to take a look at you.

553
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,759
Sometimes,

554
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,759
they even waited for half an hour.

555
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:46,719
Oh, so,

556
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,840
you're one of them.

557
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,080
Of course not.

558
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,120
I still haven't

559
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,959
figured out

560
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,919
why they waited so long

561
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:53,959
just to see you.

562
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:54,999
Would that make you

563
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,120
the boyfriend of one of them?

564
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,400
Well, it didn't work.

565
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,080
Now I'm thinking,

566
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,360
if they knew

567
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:04,959
we're together,

568
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,999
what would it be like

569
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,320
a horrible scene?

570
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,959
I'm yours anyway.

571
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:09,719
They can't take me away.

572
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:16,999
Since we're here,

573
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,439
why don't go inside and take a look?

574
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,840
Can we?

575
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,040
We may be stopped by the security.

576
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,519
Come with me,

577
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,919
be careful.

578
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,439
Where we are?

579
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,239
I once saw the most

580
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,360
beautiful sunset

581
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,120
in the world here.

582
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,919
Oh, right!

583
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,519
You're sitting

584
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
right there before.

585
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,439
I thought you're gonna commit suicide,

586
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,439
I ran over and hugged you.

587
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,320
You told me

588
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,519
that I must protect myself

589
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,519
to enjoy a bright future.

590
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,360
In fact,

591
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,239
I wasn't...

592
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,560
Okay, stop here.

593
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,080
I realized later that

594
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,479
you're not gonna jump off the building.

595
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,120
I were young then,

596
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,199
acting like a know-all.

597
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,040
Such an embarrassing episode,

598
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,320
you still remember it?

599
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,880
Of course.

600
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,040
Xiaoning,

601
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:45,279
actually...

602
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,439
You don't need to comfort me.

603
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,439
I'm really good.

604
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,040
You know, you're a good girl.

605
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,199
Lu Sijing is not the only one

606
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:58,840
who knows this.

607
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,479
I've thought it over anyway.

608
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
He always

609
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,160
talked about

610
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,679
the beautiful memories

611
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,160
we have had

612
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,800
over years.

613
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:14,479
And it's true.

614
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,120
He didn't do as he said

615
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,959
to cherish our relationship,

616
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,120
to put it

617
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,959
in the first place.

618
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,919
And now,

619
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,719
for him,

620
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,880
I don't have any feelings at all.

621
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,560
It's really all over.

622
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,080
For the past,

623
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,679
let's not talk about it anymore.

624
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,840
Don't affect our

625
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,880
mood now.

626
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:37,360
Come here.

627
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,719
Is it possible for us to see fireworks?

628
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,160
Xiaoning,

629
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,360
if I told you

630
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,880
I loved you silently for a decade,

631
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,800
would this

632
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,959
be a kinda

633
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,279
pressure for you?

634
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,080
Forget it.

635
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,199
Let bygones be bygones.

636
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,759
we can together

637
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,959
make new memories.

638
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,959
Lu Sijing,

639
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,919
won't report me and Ji Yuheng

640
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,239
'cause I reject him,

641
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,999
will he?

642
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:04,919
Perhaps,

643
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,519
it won't be that bad.

644
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:10,719
But I can't

645
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,199
gamble our future

646
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,880
on him, right?

647
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:16,840
What if...

648
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,880
Xiaoning, give it to me.

649
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,679
No,

650
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,959
it's not my turn to clean today.

651
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,320
Are you sure?

652
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:25,679
Sorry,

653
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,880
I have a question for you.

654
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,120
How about

655
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,959
we make a rule

656
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,239
when at home?

657
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,519
Look,

658
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,519
we've been together for a short time,

659
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,439
it's hard to understand each other.

660
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
Besides,

661
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,800
you are my superior.

662
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,560
This makes misunderstandings easier.

663
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,199
I think we should

664
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,919
clarify our identities

665
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,759
between home

666
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:52,600
and work.

667
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:53,800
Otherwise,

668
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,959
it's easy to have problems.

669
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,199
It makes sense.

670
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,919
They shouldn't be

671
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,279
mixed together.

672
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,479
What's your plan?

673
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,800
The negative emotions

674
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,160
caused by bickering at home

675
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,719
cannot be brought to work.

676
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,400
I believe

677
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,479
you won't retaliate

678
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,679
against me at work, right?

679
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,400
Of course not.

680
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,560
And I have an idea too.

681
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,320
Please.

682
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,080
After work,

683
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,279
stop the red tape towards me.

684
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,560
Any complaints

685
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,279
you make about me

686
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,919
at work cannot be taken home,

687
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:23,719
let alone

688
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,120
get angry with me

689
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,959
because of it.

690
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,360
Well,

691
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,919
we will call

692
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,600
Mr. Ji and Ms. Tu at work.

693
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Then at home,

694
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,999
we're Tu Xiaoning

695
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,959
and Ji Yuheng.

696
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,759
Okay,

697
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,080
Mr. Ji.

698
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,160
Oh, no!

699
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,519
Ji Yuheng.

700
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,160
Besides,

701
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,120
we live together.

702
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,239
Inevitably,

703
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,679
our living expenses will be mixed.

704
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,719
Logically,

705
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,279
someone should hold the purse strings.

706
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,400
It sounds like

707
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,279
you're interested

708
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,840
in taking charge of the finances.

709
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,080
I didn't mean it.

710
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,239
I believe you're better

711
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,519
at this than me.

712
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:10,959
What's this?

713
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:11,999
These

714
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:13,439
are all my demand deposit.

715
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,040
Some savings are for financial products.

716
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,400
I'll organize them later,

717
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,999
then send it to you.

718
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,999
I'll link the pay card

719
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,679
to your phone.

720
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,080
The password

721
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,600
is the same as the one for the door lock.

722
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,800
Are you sure you want me to handle this?

723
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,279
You don't want to?

724
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:30,439
No.

725
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,999
Well, then,

726
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,560
should I

727
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,679
give you money every month?

728
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,759
How much is appropriate?

729
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,880
No expenses for housing,

730
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,400
I just need some

731
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,120
for clothing,

732
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,160
food, transportation, and fishing

733
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,400
with the President sometime.

734
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,479
That's all.

735
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,479
Don't you any part of it

736
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,279
for entertainment?

737
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,239
It should be considered.

738
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,279
How much do you want?

739
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:54,959
In this respect,

740
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,719
you have the final say.

741
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,160
But seriously,

742
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,999
I really want to go somewhere

743
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:01,640
with you.

744
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,600
Where?

745
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,519
It's quite crowded.

746
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,360
Ji Yuheng,

747
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,080
have you been here often before?

748
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,279
Nope. First time.

749
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:21,479
What a coincidence!

750
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,040
Me too.

751
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,400
Oh, that's to say,

752
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,479
whenever you go camping again,

753
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,519
I'll be the one you think of.

754
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:35,679
Let's go.

755
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,560
That's amazing.

756
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,719
You don't even need instructions

757
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:08,759
to get it right.

758
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,040
Thank you.

759
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,959
I'm only

760
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:22,440
younger than you a year.

761
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:23,920
What do I always

762
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,399
feel like you're much more

763
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:27,120
mature and knowledgeable

764
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,199
than me?

765
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:30,040
If you think so,

766
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:31,520
it may be

767
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:32,440
'cause I have

768
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,239
richer experience

769
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,080
in various aspects.

770
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,719
Why don't you tell me?

771
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:40,319
When I was very young,

772
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:41,120
I've been

773
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,000
living on my own.

774
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,799
I washed my clothes,

775
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,960
and cooked by myself.

776
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,120
When I was a freshman in uni,

777
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,960
my spare time

778
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,920
was used

779
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:50,879
for an internship,

780
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,679
in securities firms, banks,

781
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:54,359
and investment banks.

782
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,759
I went to all of them.

783
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,759
Later,

784
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,160
I studied abroad as a graduate student,

785
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,480
I even interned

786
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,520
on Wall Street.

787
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,239
You can see,

788
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,359
I have more social experience

789
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,920
than others.

790
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,000
You've

791
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,239
got yourself so full.

792
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,679
When you're in uni,

793
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,719
didn't you have any

794
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,000
leisure time?

795
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,040
Reading books,

796
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:12,839
listening to songs,

797
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,640
and playing basketball...

798
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:15,199
Do those count?

799
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:16,799
No,

800
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,080
I mean,

801
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,120
playing games,

802
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,359
going to Internet cafes and stuff.

803
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:25,080
Internet cafe?

804
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,319
Yeah.

805
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,359
When I was in college,

806
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,080
the boys in my class

807
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,839
used to go there

808
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:29,879
paying games all night long.

809
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,000
I didn't.

810
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:34,319
Self-disciplined.

811
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,520
Then,

812
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,480
at that time,

813
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,319
did you ever fall in love?

814
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:45,199
No, I didn't.

815
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,679
Have you ever had feelings for anyone?

816
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,279
You don't even have a favorite,

817
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,000
do you?

818
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:53,960
Of course, I do.

819
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,839
Then...

820
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,160
what happened?

821
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,560
You didn't confess to her,

822
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,319
and go after her?

823
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,520
Actually,

824
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,040
when I wanna do that,

825
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,239
I found she already had a boyfriend.

826
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,600
That's why

827
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,600
she never knew

828
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
you liked her.

829
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,000
No, she didn't.

830
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,319
It's a pity.

831
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:17,640
Why do you say that?

832
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,480
I feel sorry

833
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,440
for that girl.

834
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,440
You're so nice and good.

835
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,440
It's a shame to miss you.

836
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,600
You said I know everything,

837
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,719
but I really don't deserve it.

838
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,799
I've always thought

839
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,560
I'm just an ordinary person.

840
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:53,799
My father

841
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:54,679
died early,

842
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,239
and my mom is sick.

843
00:36:58,359 --> 00:36:59,640
So there are many things

844
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,319
I don't know.

845
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,399
After graduation,

846
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,600
I have to keep learning

847
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,600
to accumulate experience.

848
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:06,679
So there's no time

849
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,759
for anything else.

850
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,040
That's to say,

851
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,520
no one

852
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:16,799
can success easily.

853
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,480
You've achieved

854
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:19,799
what you're doing now

855
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,679
in a short period of time.

856
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,000
It's all because

857
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,399
you down to earth,

858
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,839
step by step.

859
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:28,120
People

860
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,879
only see

861
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,239
your bright and shiny side,

862
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:32,279
they don't see the pain behind you,

863
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:35,520
including me.

864
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,160
Thank you, Mr. Ji,

865
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,799
for telling me this.

866
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,160
I feel

867
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,799
I understand you better.

868
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,120
In fact, I'd like to thank you more

869
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,759
for willing to know my story.

870
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:56,719
I'll do it.

871
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:13,480
Ji Yuheng,

872
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,399
when I accompanied you to meet clients,

873
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,920
I thought you were a good drinker,

874
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:18,799
you've only had a few beers.

875
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,440
Are you kidding me?

876
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,239
Ji Yuheng,

877
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,239
didn't you bring two sleeping bags?

878
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,279
I clearly remember

879
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,160
there're two.

880
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:04,399
Where did the other go?

881
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
C'mon...

882
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:19,839
out in the middle of nowhere,

883
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,279
we're here to share a bed.

884
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,040
You're awake.

885
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,000
They seem to have some wine left,

886
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,960
how about borrowing some?

887
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,080
Don't be

888
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,319
a wet blanket.

889
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,480
They should be asleep.

890
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,319
Go back now.

891
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,000
Did you have a good day?

892
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:58,960
Will you put it today

893
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:01,279
in your memories?

894
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:07,839
Good night.

895
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:12,080
Mr. Ji.

896
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,120
What's on your mind?

897
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,199
Good morning.

898
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,759
Good morning.

899
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

900
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,239
Nothing.

901
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm not thinking anything,

902
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,679
don't be silly.

903
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,120
I thought

904
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,520
you're regret about last night.

905
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,839
Why?

906
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,920
Nothing to be regret.

907
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,399
Last night,

908
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:27,319
I lost my mind,

909
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
and I don't remember anything.

910
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,040
But,

911
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,000
I didn't lose my mind.

912
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,319
I remember everything you said.

913
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:39,520
I mean, all of it.

914
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,960
What did I say?

915
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,960
I'm nice,

916
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,520
dashing,

917
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,960
and meet your aesthetic preferences.

918
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,239
I have charming eyes,

919
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
and a nice nose

920
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
and mouth.

921
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,520
Did I say that?

922
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,319
Impossible.

923
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:03,199
I would never say that.

924
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,960
How could I?

925
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,120
Ji Yuheng, are you lying to me?

926
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:13,879
I'm angry!

927
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm hungry, I wanna go home for breakfast.

928
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,399
Well, Tu Xiaoning would be like this

929
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:29,560
when in love.

930
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,560
Are you okay?

931
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,040
What took you so long to get sleeping bags?

932
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:06,799
I'll be right there.

933
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:28,480
I'm coming.
