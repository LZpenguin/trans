English subtitles are available

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:45,360
You Are My Secret EP16

3
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,239
Morning!

4
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,000
So coincidental!

5
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,800
Is it?

6
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,119
Isn't this the only route

7
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,319
for breakfast?

8
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,160
Mr. Zhao.

9
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,119
What's with

10
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,199
your outfit?

11
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,000
You look like a host.

12
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:27,879
You're not waiting for me, are you?

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,680
Do you really want me to wait for you?

14
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,280
I, um,

15
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:36,840
I have some dates lined up

16
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,479
after I get back.

17
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,160
But,

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,479
if you need companion,

19
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,440
considering

20
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,440
the years we've been colleagues,

21
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,799
I'll keep you company.

22
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,359
Wearing a suit,

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,120
and a tie.

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
Are you helping grandma collect clams?

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,400
Can't you say something nice?

26
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,120
Mr. Ji.

27
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:16,240
Mr. Ji!

28
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,319
Boss.

29
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,400
Surprised, aren't you?

30
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,199
I'm on a business trip to Jinghai,

31
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
so I thought I'd drop by.

32
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,560
How's the shipyard negotiation going?

33
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,240
Just the two of you?

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,639
Where are Xiaoning and Yuhui?

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,560
I didn't expect you

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,680
to be so concerned

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,479
about the loan

38
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,799
for the shipyard.

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,120
Regarding that project,

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,479
Xiaoning has nearly wrapped it up.

41
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,479
And we're all set

42
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,359
to go back and start the process.

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,799
Yuhui

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,039
went back early.

45
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
She's already checked in

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,960
with Xu Li today.

47
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,079
It seems

48
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,000
everything is going well.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
Xiaoning and Yuhui

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,000
did a great job this time.

51
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,799
Mr. Ji,

52
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,000
did you just arrive today?

53
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,440
Yes.

54
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,919
I asked you this because yesterday

55
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,720
Mr. Zhao mentioned he saw you.

56
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,759
You miss me that much?

57
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,199
I must be drunken.

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,120
I was seeing things; I also missed you.

59
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,240
Let's go.

60
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,039
Time for breakfast.

61
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,559
Well,

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,439
you two go ahead.

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,239
I'll go back and get Xiaoning.

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,200
This morning,

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,239
when I left the room,

66
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,160
I had no idea

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,799
if Xiaoning was in the room.

68
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,840
Ji Yuheng, you animal!

69
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,359
Xiaoning!

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,239
Xiaoning?

71
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,599
Ms. Rao.

72
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:10,960
Still sleeping?

73
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm here.

74
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,919
What time is it?

75
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,359
Is it time to check out?

76
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,080
I overslept.

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,679
It's OK.

78
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:17,880
If you're awake, why not get up?

79
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Get ready.

80
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,239
Mr. Ji is here.

81
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,559
Mr. Ji is here?

82
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,760
He mentioned

83
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,119
he stopped by on his way back.

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,559
He's going back with us today.

85
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,119
Since you're awake,

86
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,119
get up and get ready.

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,239
Let's have breakfast together.

88
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,840
OK.

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,479
I'll wait for you at the breakfast spot.

90
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:40,760
Make it fast.

91
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,239
Would you like some, Xiaoning?

92
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,479
No thanks.

93
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:02,080
Alright.

94
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,320
Could you skip the beer?

95
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,400
When I

96
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,760
see someone drinking beer,

97
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:19,520
and when I smell it,

98
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:20,439
I'll just...

99
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,799
Don't throw up in here!

100
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,640
It's so disgusting.

101
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,200
I'll go get some water.

102
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,160
I'll go with you.

103
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,799
Don't go, you!

104
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,039
Hey,

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,080
Take your hand away.

106
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:31,919
Before,

107
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,119
I never got seasick.

108
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,119
It must be the aftereffects

109
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,999
from drinking with you that day.

110
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,160
You have to take care of me.

111
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:42,880
Take care of you?

112
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:44,679
Why should I?

113
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,479
Because

114
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,160
you're in my debt.

115
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:52,760
Fine,

116
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:54,919
I'll take care of you then.

117
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:56,720
Here.

118
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,520
Let me

119
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,479
cool you down with this.

120
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,320
Feeling better?

121
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,119
A bit better.

122
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,280
Better, huh?

123
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,520
Just enjoy.

124
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,799
After all, it's going to cost you 2000

125
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,799
for an hour.

126
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,919
Why do I have to pay for this?

127
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,720
You want it free? Fine.

128
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,239
Give me clients from state-owned enterprises.

129
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,760
Please at least act like a human being.

130
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,760
I'm quite a lovely human being.

131
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:26,999
Give it to him, now.

132
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:27,919
Take it, here.

133
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,720
You take one too.

134
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,640
I'll give Mr. Ji one.

135
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,880
Alright.

136
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:33,960
Drink up!

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,559
Hurry.

138
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,239
Have some water.

139
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:39,840
Thanks.

140
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,320
You don't look so well.

141
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,439
Are you having a fever?

142
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,960
No.

143
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,320
I'm just feeling really seasick today.

144
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,400
What?

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,359
Aren't you worried they'll see us?

146
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,359
You're my superior.

147
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:07,320
It's

148
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,559
perfectly normal to take care of

149
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,720
a superior who's unwell.

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,080
I think it's because

151
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,520
I was so exhausted last night.

152
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,799
You have the nerve to bring that up.

153
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,880
I covered it up with a lot of makeup.

154
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,080
You should go back.

155
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:27,840
Drink up, OK?

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,039
Is Mr. Ji alright?

157
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,599
He's a bit seasick.

158
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
You never get seasick?

159
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,319
I was seasick a little today.

160
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,919
517, that's my taxi.

161
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:47,439
Ms. Rao.

162
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,199
Mr. Zhao.

163
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,880
My taxi is here. I'm going first.

164
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Mr. Ji, see you.

165
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,959
Have a safe trip home.

166
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:52,799
Let me help you with that.

167
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,719
Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

168
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,319
No problem.

169
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:56,520
Get in.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,919
Get in the car.

171
00:08:59,079 --> 00:08:59,520
Come on.

172
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,160
See you, Ms. Rao.

173
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,199
See ya.

174
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,199
Later, Xiaoning.

175
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,559
Later.

176
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,000
Later!

177
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,240
Hello?

178
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,880
Sorry,

179
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
I'm quite far from you.

180
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,559
I won't make it.

181
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,559
Please call another one.

182
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,319
How could you just cancel on me?

183
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:19,880
Let me tell you,

184
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,079
I'll file a complaint against you.

185
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,079
Hello!

186
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,160
Ms. Rao,

187
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,719
my ride is here.

188
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,799
If you want, I can give you a ride,

189
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,400
putting aside our past grievances.

190
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,799
Mr. Ji, where's your ride?

191
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:31,240
Mine

192
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,559
should be here any moment now.

193
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,319
You two go ahead.

194
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,640
OK, see you then.

195
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,400
I'll get that.

196
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:39,360
Get some rest.

197
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,000
Hello?

198
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,079
They've left.

199
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:51,959
Okie Dokie.

200
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:01,880
Coming.

201
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:15,640
What are you smiling about?

202
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,120
I just find it quite amusing.

203
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,360
Are you feeling any better?

204
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:23,719
Yes.

205
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,079
What's up?

206
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,079
It's Mr. Zhao.

207
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,799
Get down, now!

208
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,439
Young folks these days.

209
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,959
Get up.

210
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
Why does it feel like

211
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,959
after the trip,

212
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:14,280
there're no safe places

213
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,839
on this planet?

214
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,000
It's even more dangerous than before.

215
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,760
If Mr. Zhao and Ms. Rao

216
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,640
found out about

217
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,240
us dating,

218
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,799
then it wouldn’t take long

219
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:23,600
for everyone to find out.

220
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:27,520
Yeah,

221
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,160
it's actually quite thrilling.

222
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,679
But it could also be

223
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,000
because we're

224
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,360
getting too intimate.

225
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,039
That's perfectly normal.

226
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,439
We are

227
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,160
about to get married.

228
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,439
It's only natural

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
to be intimate, right?

230
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,880
You're absolutely right.

231
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,199
We're getting married soon.

232
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,959
I said 12; he's running late again.

233
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,160
I'm Qi Yu.

234
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,079
Hello, sir.

235
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:05,520
Hello, sir. I'm Qi Yu.

236
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,559
I went to the same college

237
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,240
with Weiyi.

238
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:09,120
We are

239
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,039
in a romantic relationship.

240
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Don't be so uptight.

241
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,839
My dad isn't scary.

242
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,160
He won't bite you.

243
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,400
Um,

244
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,439
did you mention to him

245
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,439
what my current job is?

246
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,039
I did tell him.

247
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,000
You told him?

248
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,439
Would he consider my job...

249
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,160
It's fine.

250
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,120
I don't even care about it.

251
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,799
What does he care?

252
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,280
It's not like he's the one dating you.

253
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,360
Sweet heart.

254
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,559
He's here.

255
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,240
Dad.

256
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,439
You may leave us.

257
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:38,360
Dad.

258
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,240
You've been waiting for a while, right?

259
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,319
You must be famished.

260
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,039
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

261
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,480
I was in a meeting.

262
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,880
Hello, sir. I'm Qi Yu.

263
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,000
Here's a little gift.

264
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,600
You're being kind.

265
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,199
You really didn't have to do this.

266
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,480
I have a last-minute

267
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,400
meeting to attend soon.

268
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,120
Let's not eat elsewhere.

269
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,160
Let's have dim sum in the conference room.

270
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,120
Dad.

271
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,160
I gave you a heads-up

272
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,039
well in advance.

273
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,160
Why is there suddenly a meeting?

274
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,319
That's not fair.

275
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,480
I want to eat somewhere else.

276
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,719
It's fine.

277
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,520
His work is important.

278
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,240
Eating in the conference room is fine.

279
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,079
It's convenient.

280
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:16,520
Alright then.

281
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,839
Let's go.

282
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,480
How can we eat in the conference room?

283
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,240
It's all the same.

284
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,199
Come on, don't be upset.

285
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,679
Dad!

286
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,760
Have some of this.

287
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,079
Yu,

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,240
what do you do for a living.

289
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,719
Dad.

290
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,280
Didn't I mention it to you before?

291
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,000
My daughter,

292
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,799
I've really spoiled her rotten.

293
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,120
Please be more patient.

294
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,919
Not at all.

295
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,000
Weiyi is truly wonderful.

296
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:52,799
She's a fantastic girl.

297
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,719
Her personality is great too.

298
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,079
Great personality?

299
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,520
Yeah.

300
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,839
Lovers find beauty beyond the surface.

301
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,480
You young folks,

302
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,079
when it comes to relationships,

303
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,559
you always get impulsive.

304
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,319
Dad.

305
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,679
Is my personality really that bad?

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,360
Good, good.

307
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,319
When in love,

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,120
it's natural to be impulsive.

309
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,559
But to maintain a lasting relationship,

310
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,679
you need to be rational.

311
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:20,799
As for me,

312
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,919
I'm not an old-fashioned person.

313
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:24,520
I don't care about the house you live in

314
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,880
or how much

315
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,760
money you have.

316
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,280
But there's one thing I value highly,

317
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,760
and that is

318
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,120
a man

319
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,360
must have ambition.

320
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,280
Only then can the two of you

321
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,120
build a good life together.

322
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,120
Sir, don't worry.

323
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:41,799
I'm preparing to take the police exam.

324
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,719
Where are you at now?

325
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,240
Have you passed the written test?

326
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,079
Dad!

327
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,280
This exam

328
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,959
is held every year

329
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:48,880
at a fixed time.

330
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:50,280
You don't know anything about it,

331
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,959
so maybe it's best to leave him be.

332
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,400
Sir, don't worry.

333
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,760
I'm already preparing for it.

334
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,480
I'll do my utmost

335
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,199
to pass it.

336
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,160
Please trust me.

337
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,600
How about this?

338
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,520
Let's put your relationship

339
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,520
with Weiyi on hold for now.

340
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,439
Let's wait after you pass it,

341
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,120
alright?

342
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,919
Dad!

343
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,400
Let's eat.

344
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,959
Slow down.

345
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,880
Why did you

346
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,520
stop me earlier?

347
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,959
Why should we put it on hold?

348
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,039
Who can predict the result of the exam?

349
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,039
His expectations of me

350
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,839
aren't unreasonable.

351
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,839
He's not asking me to be filthy rich.

352
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,480
He just wants me to have ambition

353
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,160
and to be dependable.

354
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,520
He cares about you,

355
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,439
which is why he has expectations of me.

356
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,079
But just like he said,

357
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,199
that exam is really tough.

358
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,199
What if...

359
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,240
I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.

360
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,439
But hard work can make up for that, right?

361
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,880
I've signed up for a tutoring class.

362
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,520
I've been sticking to

363
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
the study plan I created.

364
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,959
I can't guarantee

365
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,079
a 100% success,

366
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,160
but I will definitely

367
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
give it my all.

368
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,559
Just trust me.

369
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,480
Alright then.

370
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,520
I'll help you prepare for it.

371
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,000
Maybe you could

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,679
pass on your first try.

373
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,959
You live in such a high-end neighborhood.

374
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
No wonder you can't save any money.

375
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,919
You always go for the best in everything.

376
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:33,760
You really

377
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,719
don't hold back on yourself.

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,640
What's wrong?

379
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,520
You look so pale.

380
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm fine.

381
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,400
My stomach is acting up.

382
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,520
Having some hot water should help.

383
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:45,760
Let me help you upstairs.

384
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:48,839
Hands

385
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,160
off.

386
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,760
By the way, my place

387
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,679
is not open to strangers.

388
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,719
And another thing,

389
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,199
don't think that just

390
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:57,880
because you met my parents

391
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,640
and shared a couple of drinks with me

392
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,679
that we have a close bond.

393
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,799
When it comes to competing for clients,

394
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,799
I won't go easy on you.

395
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,120
Thanks.

396
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,000
See ya.

397
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,520
That's not what I meant.

398
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,240
Li Xiang,

399
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,520
come over here!

400
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,000
Even though I didn't buy much,

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,240
please, all of you, help yourself.

402
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,439
Thanks.

403
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,439
Thank you, Xiaoning.

404
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,080
No problem.

405
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:26,880
Mr. Zhao,

406
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,400
Xiaoning bought us gifts over there.

407
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,160
Ms. Rao brought us souvenirs.

408
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,360
What about you?

409
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,560
I just went on a business trip

410
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,840
and didn't make any money.

411
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,640
It wasn't a vacation.

412
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,600
Let's skip gifts.

413
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,919
How stingy!

414
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,560
Besides,

415
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:39,640
Ms. Rao brought you souvenirs

416
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,560
because Xihai Town is her...

417
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,400
My what?

418
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,919
It's your town of fortune.

419
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
Your apprentice signed contracts.

420
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,560
That's your blessing.

421
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,880
Exactly.

422
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,120
Here, Mr. Zhao.

423
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,040
Thanks.

424
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,600
Where's Yuhui?

425
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,439
She's not feeling down after

426
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,040
losing to Xiaoning, is she?

427
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,959
No,

428
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,840
she applied for a new business trip.

429
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,160
She won't be back before the New Year.

430
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,279
Another business trip?

431
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,800
This girl is really resilient.

432
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:03,679
It's so lively here!

433
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,040
Gifts?

434
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,519
Is there any for me?

435
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:11,400
Boss,

436
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,360
you're getting funnier!

437
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,400
Didn't you go to

438
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,040
Xihai Town yourself?

439
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,800
You also went to Xihai Town?

440
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,999
To cheer for your juniors?

441
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,120
What are you talking about?

442
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,279
Li Xiang.

443
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,239
Xiaoning.

444
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,040
You...

445
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,919
hurt your neck?

446
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,120
It's OK.

447
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,479
It was the boat.

448
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:35,519
It was rocking badly.

449
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,600
I lost my balance

450
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:37,519
and

451
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,160
and got scratched by a wire.

452
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,999
How careless.

453
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,040
Just recently,

454
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,880
I cut my hand

455
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,600
while trimming paper.

456
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:45,880
I still have some meds here.

457
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,439
Hey,

458
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,479
let me get you the meds.

459
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,040
You should let Ms. Rao help you apply it.

460
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,519
It's OK.

461
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,239
It's just a minor scratch.

462
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:50,999
Really, it's not necessary.

463
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,239
Listen,

464
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,759
pay attention to small injuries.

465
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,120
That's fine.

466
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,400
Especially scratches from metal items,

467
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,279
they can easily leave scars.

468
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,239
Honestly, it's really not necessary.

469
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,279
Guys,

470
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,519
I have some

471
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,320
good news to share.

472
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,040
This month, Ms. Rao

473
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,719
has brought in three new clients.

474
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,239
As expected from our

475
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,840
star employee in section one.

476
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,880
I'll keep pushing forward, everyone.

477
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,239
Did I hear that right?

478
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:12,880
Three clients?

479
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,959
Ms. Rao,

480
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,279
you're awesome!

481
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,759
Seems you're the type who pretends to

482
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,120
have fun with classmates during the day

483
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,560
and studies hard

484
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,759
at night.

485
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:23,919
Do I have to pretend with you?

486
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,040
Help Xiaoning

487
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,479
with this.

488
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,239
Stomach pain again?

489
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:47,519
If you're injured, cut down on coffee.

490
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,600
It can lead to pigmentation.

491
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,080
Have some red dates water.

492
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,080
It's just a minor scratch.

493
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,840
You really don't need to fuss over me.

494
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:55,959
We're

495
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,439
all comrades in the same boat.

496
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,160
It's natural to look out for one another.

497
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,160
I've still got one left here.

498
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,959
It's not taken.

499
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:04,840
How about this,

500
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,360
take it to Ms. Rao.

501
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,679
Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

502
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,120
No problem.

503
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,959
Ms. Rao,

504
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,279
this is from Mr. Zhao.

505
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:18,759
What's this?

506
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,160
Red dates water.

507
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,080
How come Mr. Liu

508
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,120
has so many packages?

509
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,600
Let me see.

510
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Your skin looks so radiant today.

511
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,040
Seems you could squeeze water out of it!

512
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,239
Love really is

513
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,160
the best beauty treatment.

514
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,160
What?

515
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,800
After a few days

516
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,080
in a whirlwind of passion,

517
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,239
and now you're treating me as an outsider?

518
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,360
I knew it!

519
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,439
This Ji Yuheng,

520
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:11,959
- he definitely... - Shut up!

521
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,919
What's wrong with you?

522
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:14,759
Can you please

523
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,679
stay at least 1km away

524
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,239
from this gate

525
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,360
before you mention Ji Yuheng's name?

526
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,919
I just landed a client,

527
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,880
and I really don't want to get fired.

528
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

529
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,439
I just wanted to express my thoughts.

530
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,919
A guy like this,

531
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,880
who is both talented and good-looking,

532
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,239
and willing to be with you every day.

533
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,160
How did such a great guy

534
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,959
suddenly

535
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,160
popped up

536
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,959
out of nowhere,

537
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,199
and jumped right into your arms?

538
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,519
Luck is also a kind of strength.

539
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,080
What's wrong?

540
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,040
Is Mr. Qi

541
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,400
not perfect enough?

542
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,160
You don't like him anymore?

543
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,160
Of course he's great.

544
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,199
But you have no idea

545
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,600
how hard he's been working lately.

546
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,040
His persistence...

547
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,160
drives me nuts.

548
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:53,959
What happened?

549
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:33,439
Just think about it,

550
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,160
he's worked so hard,

551
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,800
and if he still doesn't pass the exam...

552
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,279
wouldn't that be...

553
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,400
Unjust.

554
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,600
Exactly.

555
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,120
He's really done so much

556
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,919
to be with you.

557
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,959
When does he take the exam?

558
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,439
Today.

559
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,320
Today?

560
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,479
No wonder

561
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:52,600
you seem so distracted today.

562
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,719
Don't worry.

563
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:56,840
How about this,

564
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:57,679
I'll share some of my good luck

565
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,919
from passing my exam with him.

566
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,479
No, you can't do that.

567
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,199
You are at a critical stage to get permanent contract

568
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,759
and you can't afford to lose any luck,

569
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,840
not even for Qi Yu.

570
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,919
It's fine.

571
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,759
It seems a sure thing now,

572
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,519
so I'll share some with Mr. Qi

573
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,160
and wish him

574
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,959
good luck with his exam.

575
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,919
You're a true friend,

576
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:18,560
really loyal.

577
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,479
I'm off, Xiaoning.

578
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,400
Bye.

579
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:22,959
Bye.

580
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:23,959
-Bye. -Bye.

581
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,120
Bye.

582
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,040
Bye.

583
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,679
Bye.

584
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,080
Xiaoning,

585
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,360
aren't you off work yet?

586
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,320
You go ahead, Fanggang.

587
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,160
I have a

588
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,519
financial report to review.

589
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,600
Life is long.

590
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,919
Don't push yourself all the time.

591
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,080
When it's time to clock out, clock out.

592
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,199
When it's time to live, live.

593
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,040
Otherwise,

594
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:43,719
money's in the bank, you're in heaven.

595
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,840
What's the point?

596
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:49,800
Learn from your mentor;

597
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,519
she works hard during the day,

598
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,600
but once it's off work,

599
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,919
who knows where she's off to enjoy life.

600
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,040
I'm out.

601
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,040
Bye.

602
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:56,560
Bye.

603
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:57,560
I'm off, boss.

604
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,120
All right.

605
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:17,600
Finally, everyone's gone.

606
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,800
Uh...

607
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,360
Still here this late?

608
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,679
I was just about to head home.

609
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,840
What's wrong? Didn't you already leave?

610
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,239
I forgot my badge.

611
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:35,439
I'm heading out now,

612
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,239
bye.

613
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:36,759
Bye.

614
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:38,160
Mr. Zhang,

615
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,360
I'm on my way.

616
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,279
Coming.

617
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:40,959
Wait for me.

618
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,239
So...

619
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,120
Since you're heading out,

620
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:50,719
shall we go together?

621
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:53,479
Sure, Mr. Ji.

622
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,160
Let's go.

623
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:01,919
Mr. Ji.

624
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,519
Xiaoning,

625
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,719
how's

626
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:07,519
work going lately?

627
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,160
It's going well.

628
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,199
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

629
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:12,560
Come here.

630
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,800
What's up?

631
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,120
No one else is around.

632
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:35,479
Qi Yu?

633
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,919
I had planned to take the day off

634
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,080
for my exam and wasn't

635
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,719
at the company,

636
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,919
but since the manager is leaving

637
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:53,759
on a business trip tomorrow,

638
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,439
I went back to the office

639
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:54,959
to

640
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,320
sort things out early.

641
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,880
I messed up.

642
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:01,679
I swear,

643
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,120
I didn't mean

644
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,239
to tell him

645
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:04,880
about you two.

646
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,320
Blame it on the enemy

647
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,679
being both simple and cunning,

648
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,199
which lowered my guard.

649
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,279
Just one question,

650
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,239
Qi Yu wouldn't

651
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:14,999
rat us out, right?

652
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
No, no, no,

653
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,759
he wouldn't.

654
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,560
If he ever dares,

655
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,640
I'd be the first to take him down.

656
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,320
Promise.

657
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,840
I won't.

658
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,400
All right,

659
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,320
today,

660
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,679
to show my apologies,

661
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,759
I'm covering

662
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,360
all the expenses tonight.

663
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:33,160
Excuse me,

664
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,919
two bottles of Blue Ribbon.

665
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,600
We don't usually drink like this.

666
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,679
Your apology comes

667
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:45,279
with a hefty price tag.

668
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,479
Let's have fun.

669
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,040
Today's a good day.

670
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,040
First,

671
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,759
I'm apologizing

672
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,919
for telling Qi Yu

673
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:53,800
about you two,

674
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,479
and second,

675
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,479
we're celebrating

676
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,479
you two...

677
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,840
we're celebrating Qi Yu

678
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,880
successfully finishing his exam.

679
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,439
I did pretty well

680
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,279
on the written exam;

681
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,199
I think I've got

682
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:13,840
a good chance of passing.

683
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,959
Really?

684
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,279
That's great!

685
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:16,719
Come on, cheers!

686
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:17,600
Congratulations!

687
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,519
Congratulations!

688
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,239
Congratulations!

689
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,400
So,

690
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,160
keep going?

691
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,640
Of course.

692
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:27,800
Come on,

693
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:28,800
let's go dance.

694
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,840
Let's go.

695
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,479
Didn't you say you wouldn't dance?

696
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,959
So...

697
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,959
Sit down.

698
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,160
Our girlfriends

699
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,679
are best friends,

700
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,360
so we should be

701
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:45,239
good friends too, right?

702
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,800
Calling you Mr. Ji feels too formal.

703
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,160
If I call you by your full name,

704
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,160
it feels weird.

705
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:53,360
Yuheng?

706
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,919
Feels a bit too intimate.

707
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,719
You can call me whatever you want.

708
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,880
I'll just call you Yuheng.

709
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:04,840
Yuheng.

710
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:05,600
Sure.

711
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:06,320
Come on,

712
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:08,439
Yuheng,

713
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:09,479
let's drink.

714
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:25,160
Are you going to the bathroom?

715
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,919
What?

716
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:28,360
Are you going to the bathroom?

717
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,519
Hey,

718
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:37,160
are you alone?

719
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,040
No,

720
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,999
I have a boyfriend.

721
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,600
A boyfriend?

722
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:42,919
You're not making that up

723
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:44,120
to turn me down, are you?

724
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,400
My boyfriend

725
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,719
is really handsome.

726
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,880
Listen,

727
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,080
I won't interfere

728
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,959
with your hobbies.

729
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,479
But next time if you're going out,

730
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,400
make sure to tell me in advance.

731
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,360
If you

732
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,600
get drunk,

733
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,519
I won't be able to be there right away.

734
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,160
What,

735
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,759
you want me to report to you?

736
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,679
Not satisfied?

737
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,279
Well, that depends on your behavior.

738
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,959
I'm not kidding,

739
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:15,279
bro,

740
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,840
I can handle a whole bottle.

741
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,759
And even if I do get drunk,

742
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,880
I don't transform or anything.

743
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,840
So you're saying

744
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,719
I transform when I'm drunk?

745
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,160
Go ask around,

746
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,080
I've been

747
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,120
a client manager for years

748
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,759
and never embarrassed myself

749
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,600
because of drinking.

750
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:27,999
It's recorded now.

751
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,600
Recorded.

752
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,320
Go ahead, record it.

753
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,999
I did.

754
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:30,840
You're bragging.

755
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,199
Let's be real,

756
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,199
the worst drinker

757
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,479
in our entire office

758
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,600
is...

759
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,199
Even if my drinking is bad,

760
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,560
I've never thrown up in someone's car

761
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,719
and not paid for the car wash.

762
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,919
We're not that bad, right?

763
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:47,959
Did I do

764
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,600
anything weird yesterday?

765
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,840
Seems like drinking

766
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,759
isn't for me.

767
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,199
Does falling asleep curled up

768
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:03,759
on the bathroom sink while brushing

769
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:04,360
your teeth count?

770
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,840
But it was pretty cute.

771
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,479
Red... Red envelope!

772
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,999
Boss,

773
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:24,880
you're really generous today.

774
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,840
You're giving away

775
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:26,959
your fortune.

776
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,199
Everyone,

777
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,360
it's almost New Year's.

778
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,600
We've successfully met

779
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:33,840
the bank's deposit target.

780
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:34,959
These small red envelopes

781
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,239
are just to bring some good luck.

782
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,320
The year-end bonus

783
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,999
will be settled after the holiday.

784
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,239
Great!

785
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:40,600
Yeah!

786
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,320
-Thank you, Mr. Ji! -Thank you, Mr. Ji!

787
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,040
Not bad, Mr. Ji,

788
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:46,679
learning how to win people over.

789
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,360
Xiaoning, you're flattering me.

790
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,160
This money came from an extra bonus,

791
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:50,880
not from

792
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,439
our shared savings.

793
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,360
Are you all going back home?

794
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,279
I'm not going back this year.

795
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,439
I've planned a trip

796
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,120
with some friends.

797
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,239
What about you guys?

798
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,679
I'll spend it with my family.

799
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:04,719
Boss,

800
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,040
what about you?

801
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,120
Me too,

802
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,519
with some very important family members.

803
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,479
Fanggang,

804
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,040
what about you?

805
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,160
I'm not so lucky.

806
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,239
My whole family's going to

807
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:18,479
my brother's place for New Year's,

808
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,439
so I'll be all alone.

809
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,519
You're probably spending it alone too.

810
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,360
How about

811
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,279
we pair up for New Year's?

812
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:36,919
Even at my worst,

813
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:37,959
I don't need to pair up with you.

814
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,600
Didn't mean it,

815
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,959
just joking around.

816
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,239
Ha.

817
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,640
Xu Li,

818
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,360
revise it again.

819
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,519
You're just taking it out on me.

820
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,560
Go revise it.

821
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:13,800
Come on.

822
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,800
Mr. Ji, you've got good taste.

823
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:25,400
This guesthouse is really nice.

824
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:27,239
Today is our first New Year's together

825
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,359
as a family,

826
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,080
so we should be comfortable.

827
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,759
This place is spacious.

828
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
It's got two floors.

829
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,719
You've thought of everything.

830
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,520
Otherwise, with the five of us,

831
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,719
there'd be no room

832
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,560
whether we stayed at our place

833
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,480
or my mom's.

834
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:41,120
We wouldn't be able to stay up together.

835
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:41,560
Exactly.

836
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:42,679
Let's go.

837
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:44,920
This way?

838
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,000
Yes.

839
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,399
Are you sure you don't need

840
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,199
my help later?

841
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:51,160
If you help, we might

842
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,239
end up eating New Year's dinner

843
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,879
next year.

844
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,359
Dad, Mom.

845
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,520
Dad, Mom?

846
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,399
Where is everyone?

847
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,399
Dad,

848
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,120
Mom?

849
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,080
Are they not here?

850
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:10,920
I'll go check.

851
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:11,560
Okay.

852
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,160
Everything's still here.

853
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:17,920
No one's here.

854
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,520
Maybe give them a call?

855
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,920
Phone's ringing.

856
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,199
Hello, Dad,

857
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:26,120
where are you?

858
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,440
Uh...

859
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:30,080
do you have a moment?

860
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,600
Can you come pick us up?

861
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,839
Just don't tell Xiaoning, okay?

862
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Why can't you tell me?

863
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,359
What happened?

864
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:40,920
N... nothing,

865
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,879
we're fine.

866
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,120
Just a

867
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,000
little mishap.

868
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,120
Hello?

869
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,319
What happened?

870
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,319
What kind of mishap?

871
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,480
Where are you?

872
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,600
What were you doing?

873
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,879
Catching a chicken.

874
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,399
I can see it's a chicken,

875
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:02,359
but whose idea was this?

876
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:05,719
It was mine.

877
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:09,600
Wait,

878
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:11,279
why are you catching a chicken?

879
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,239
You could've just bought one

880
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:12,920
at the market.

881
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,960
You can't get it at the market.

882
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,440
This is a free-range chicken,

883
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:18,480
and it's tastier.

884
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:19,359
So

885
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:20,719
we came here

886
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:21,480
to catch one.

887
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,040
We have everything for New Year's,

888
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,440
just needed the chicken.

889
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:26,520
Dad, Mom,

890
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:27,520
it's cold in the mountains.

891
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,520
Let's get in the car first.

892
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:29,679
Yes, hurry.

893
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,279
Bring it over.

894
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:30,920
Come on.

895
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,319
Quick, quick.

896
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,839
-Put it in the car. -Mom.

897
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,520
Let's get in the car first.

898
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,600
Your hands are dirty, Dad.

899
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,120
Just sit tight.

900
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:40,839
Here,

901
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:41,960
wipe your hands.

902
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,600
Get in the car.

903
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:45,160
Sure.

904
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:46,839
Dad,

905
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:47,759
tell me honestly,

906
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:48,960
was this Mom's idea?

907
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:50,920
It was mine.

908
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:51,960
My...

909
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,719
my idea.

910
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,759
Would you dare go catch a chicken

911
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:55,759
if Mom didn't agree?

912
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,440
This yard is really nice,

913
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,600
isn't it?

914
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,600
Yes,

915
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,960
I wonder who picked it.

916
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,359
I think I didn't buy any chicken.

917
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,000
That's not good.

918
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,199
We need chicken,

919
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,440
duck, fish, and meat for New Year's.

920
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah.

921
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,199
Are you serious?

922
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:18,600
Seriously.

923
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,440
How about

924
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,080
I call Yuheng to come back

925
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,480
and drive us to that...

926
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,199
They say there's a farmers' market.

927
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,399
We can go buy it there.

928
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:30,719
It's going to take a long time

929
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,600
to go back and forth.

930
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,679
I just remembered,

931
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,040
on the way here,

932
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,199
I think there was a farmhouse

933
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
that sells free-range chickens.

934
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,279
How about we go catch one there?

935
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,399
It's New Year's.

936
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,600
Just drop it.

937
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:43,719
It's not worth it

938
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,560
for a chicken.

939
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:46,359
It's because you

940
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:47,799
didn't prepare all the New Year's goods,

941
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,440
now we don't have chicken

942
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
for the New Year.

943
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,000
This is a chance to make up for it,

944
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,759
and you're not taking it?

945
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:53,960
Are you going or not?

946
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:56,120
Next time my mom

947
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,679
comes up with such a bad idea,

948
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,600
try to stop her.

949
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,839
My mother-in-law

950
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,279
is still sick.

951
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,600
If something happens,

952
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,120
we're far from the hospital

953
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
in this remote place.

954
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,000
It's really inconvenient.

955
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,520
Right, right,

956
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
I didn't think of that.

957
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,839
That's my oversight.

958
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:11,199
It won't happen again.

959
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,080
Celebrating New Year, what's the point?

960
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,279
It's so boring.

961
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,080
Who is it?

962
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,080
I haven't even ordered my takeout yet.

963
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:47,520
Happy New Year.

964
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,040
Can I come in?

965
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:51,120
Come in.

966
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:52,799
Take off your shoes.

967
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,120
Can you

968
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:57,239
put them in the shoe cabinet for me?

969
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,319
Your house is really big.

970
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,759
If I remember correctly,

971
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,120
today's New Year's Eve, right?

972
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:14,759
Is there a problem?

973
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,799
I brought some New Year's goods!

974
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,199
You startled me.

975
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,399
I'll put them over there.

976
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,759
Sure.

977
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,040
Your lipstick color is really nice.

978
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:26,560
It's New Year's after all.

979
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:58,000
Come on,

980
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,359
everything's ready.

981
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,080
We need to take a photo.

982
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,960
What's there to take a picture of?

983
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,120
Quick, quick.

984
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
Three, two, one,

985
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,920
Happy New Year!

986
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,199
This one's too thick.

987
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,679
Don't make the center so thick.

988
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,560
Look.

989
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,399
Are you making pancakes?

990
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,799
Look at this.

991
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:23,520
I was worried that Jing

992
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,719
would be lonely

993
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,120
spending the New Year alone,

994
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,520
but look at what Fanggang did.

995
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:29,440
Isn't the atmosphere perfect?

996
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,560
It really is nice.

997
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,199
Quite romantic too.

998
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:32,520
Here,

999
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,480
taste this for seasoning.

1000
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,080
Delicious.

1001
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:38,839
It's good?

1002
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,160
It smells so good.

1003
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,120
I've been sitting here,

1004
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
smelling it the whole time.

1005
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,000
What's the filling?

1006
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,080
It's your mother-in-law's

1007
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,560
secret

1008
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:51,080
three-delicacy filling.

1009
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,399
What secret?

1010
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,799
It's just

1011
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,120
spinach,

1012
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,199
shrimp,

1013
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,199
and pork,

1014
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,359
then

1015
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,000
it's quickly sautéed

1016
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,480
with some flavored oil.

1017
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,480
Try it later

1018
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,359
and see if you like it.

1019
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,879
Are you making dumplings?

1020
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,799
Let me help.

1021
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,920
Come on,

1022
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,000
you'll end up

1023
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:11,040
with dumplings

1024
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,199
that fall apart in the pot.

1025
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,879
Dad, you always complain

1026
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,879
that I don't know how to do anything,

1027
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,399
but then you never let me try.

1028
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,759
That's not fair!

1029
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,239
Just let me try it.

1030
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,120
What if I have

1031
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,279
a hidden talent for this?

1032
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,319
Look at her, look at her.

1033
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,000
This kid.

1034
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,879
Come on,

1035
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,679
your happiness is spilling over.

1036
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,960
Don't waste it.

1037
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,000
It's fine.

1038
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:35,799
By the way,

1039
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,679
I'm putting

1040
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,120
a coin in this one.

1041
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,640
Look,

1042
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:40,399
whoever gets

1043
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,879
the dumpling

1044
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:43,560
with the coin

1045
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,799
will have

1046
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,960
good luck this year.

1047
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:49,480
Then I'll put in a red date.

1048
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:50,120
Here.

1049
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:51,719
Mom,

1050
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,520
the coin

1051
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,759
brings good luck,

1052
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:54,480
but what does the red date mean?

1053
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,839
You don't know?

1054
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,399
I don't know.

1055
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,199
Yuheng.

1056
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,359
Yes?

1057
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,759
Do you know what

1058
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:02,960
putting a red date in a dumpling means?

1059
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:04,520
Of course I know, Mom.

1060
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:06,199
What does it mean?

1061
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:07,799
You don't know?

1062
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,920
Tell her.

1063
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,480
I don't know.

1064
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,679
It means "to have a baby soon."

1065
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,440
To have a baby soon.

1066
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,440
To have a baby soon.

1067
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,560
Xiaoning is sure

1068
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
to get that dumpling.

1069
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,960
It's New Year's.

1070
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,399
If I suggest fireworks,

1071
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:00,560
she probably won't refuse, right?

1072
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:05,000
But

1073
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,560
we don't know each other that well...

1074
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,520
How should I ask?

1075
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,199
I'm just getting some fresh air.

1076
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:17,799
Ji Yuheng?

1077
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,120
It really is you!

1078
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,960
What are you doing here?

1079
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:24,839
Relatives in this neighborhood?

1080
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
I just bought

1081
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,719
some fireworks nearby...

1082
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,359
Xiaoning,

1083
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:29,960
do you want to

1084
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,719
come down and set off fireworks?

1085
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,719
What did you say?

1086
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:35,279
I said, do you want to...

1087
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:35,600
Put on your coat

1088
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,199
and come down.

1089
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:37,359
Got it.

1090
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:39,920
Happy New Year.

1091
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,239
Happy New Year.
