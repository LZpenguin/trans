00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:45,400
You Are My Secret EP18

3
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,840
You know about the owner of the brewery,

4
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,679
right?

5
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,599
He used to work at

6
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,959
Dajiang Brewery.

7
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,800
Later on,

8
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,959
he worked for

9
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,879
August Brewery.

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,000
Then he quit his job

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,879
and went to Shanghai to pursue his career.

12
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,039
Now let me give you

13
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,240
some details about that company.

14
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,160
Hey, I'm talking about work.

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,280
You looked distracted.

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,079
Oh, OK.

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,960
I brought it...

18
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,079
It's flickering again.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
I can't tell if it's the light or

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,039
the electrical box.

21
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,720
I...

22
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,160
really fell for her.

23
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,160
Again,

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,799
is it the box

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,199
or the light?

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,479
You've got to find a technician

27
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,759
to take it down

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,280
and fix it.

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,840
That's true.

30
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,039
I haven't added the detergent yet.

31
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,879
That's fine. I'll take care of it.

32
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,000
Grab the documents and leave.

33
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,680
Still working?

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,960
Have some milk.

35
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,560
Thank you.

36
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,280
Are you OK?

37
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,400
I should have looked into

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,479
the shipyard case earlier.

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,199
But it's not your concern.

40
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,199
Verifying the case is

41
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
part of my job.

42
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,440
And you

43
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,199
have never been in touch with Mr. Yang.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
I've interacted with him several times

45
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,479
but didn't notice

46
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,680
anything unusual.

47
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,960
This is still my own issue.

48
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,840
I let myself be led around.

49
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,639
Xiaoning,

50
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,479
it's not a big deal,

51
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,160
if a project can't move forward.

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,199
Let's just take this as

53
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,960
a lesson learned.

54
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,919
Next time, you'll be more careful.

55
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,240
Besides, you've just started handling

56
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,440
these loan projects.

57
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,479
It's normal to

58
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,439
encounter some issues.

59
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,840
But Tang Yuhui

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,119
is also new to this.

61
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:36,760
Yet she can spot

62
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
the problems.

63
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,119
I, however, cannot.

64
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,559
I'm not trying to compete with her.

65
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:43,999
It's just that

66
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:45,599
the facts are clear.

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,599
I am simply not capable enough.

68
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,520
Tang Yuhui is

69
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,760
a unique case.

70
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,520
Maybe.

71
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,320
It's getting late.

72
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,799
You should get some rest.

73
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm fine.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,720
Didn't we agree on this?

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,280
Not to talk about work at home?

76
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,799
Regarding this case,

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,679
I just need some time to process it.

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
I just need to sort it out.

79
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:15,880
Should I reschedule

80
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:17,239
our weekend plans?

81
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:18,239
No.

82
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:19,720
I've already promised mom.

83
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I don't want to let her down.

84
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,280
I won't let her worry either.

85
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,479
You can rest assured.

86
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:34,559
Drink it while it's hot.

87
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,080
I'll leave you alone then.

88
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,080
Alright.

89
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,760
I don't know what's going on

90
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,520
with Xiaoning lately.

91
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,439
She seems to be daydreaming all the time.

92
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:04,720
She seems

93
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:05,840
to have lost

94
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
that spark in her eyes.

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,840
What does she need that for?

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,359
To cultivate immortality?

97
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,479
Not like you, floating around

98
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
like a fairy all day.

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,919
Don't film me.

100
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:22,919
Come on.

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,640
Film them.

102
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,760
Today's stars are

103
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,439
Yuheng and Yuhui.

104
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:26,999
- They're the stars. - Sir.

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,880
I can feel the vibe.

106
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,520
Could it be that...

107
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,999
You're the smart one.

108
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,640
Come on!

109
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,080
What are we waiting for?

110
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,520
A round of applause!

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,479
Awesome!

112
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:42,999
So, sir

113
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,320
when do we expect our bonuses?

114
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,880
It'll be yours once the deal is complete.

115
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,200
You won't miss a single cent.

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,919
Aside from this,

117
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,400
we will commend

118
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,760
our fastest rising manager,

119
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,080
Yuhui.

120
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,999
She's not only pretty but also talented.

121
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,119
Her future looks promising!

122
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,479
Keep up the great work.

123
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,400
Now,

124
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,160
since everyone is here

125
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,799
and no one is out on duty,

126
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:08,880
let's take a group photo.

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,160
Come on!

128
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,119
Come on, everyone!

129
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,080
Our section one

130
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,999
hasn't got a group photo yet.

131
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,679
Come on.

132
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,200
You join in too!

133
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:13,999
Just stand here.

134
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,119
You're the star today.

135
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,119
You should be in front.

136
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,239
Just stand here, where are you going?

137
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,919
I'm just saying...

138
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,039
It's not right for me to stand here.

139
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:20,919
What's wrong with it?

140
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:21,599
You're going nowhere.

141
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,840
Section one!

142
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,400
Let's go!

143
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:24,960
Come on!

144
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:25,359
Three.

145
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,880
Two.

146
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,320
One.

147
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,559
Shall we take another one?

148
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,720
Let's take another one.

149
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,280
Come on, come on!

150
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,280
Section one!

151
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,200
Let's go!

152
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,119
About what I mentioned in the chat.

153
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,119
Xu Li.

154
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:46,679
Regarding the company's qualifications.

155
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,400
Please take this contract back,

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,760
- and make some revisions. - Guys.

157
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,320
Let's call it a day.

158
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,320
Mr. Ji,

159
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,479
it's rare that everyone is here today,

160
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,679
and there's good news as well.

161
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,119
Let's all get together!

162
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,960
Yuhui,

163
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,439
if you want to treat us,

164
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,559
I have a place in mind.

165
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:01,960
It's perfect for drinking,

166
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,479
but it's pricey.

167
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,280
Should I

168
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,039
make a reservation now?

169
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,080
Sure!

170
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,359
Alright.

171
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:08,080
Then I'll make the reservation.

172
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,640
Xiaoning,

173
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:10,439
you're coming, right?

174
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,080
I still have work to do.

175
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,840
You all go ahead.

176
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,720
Alright.

177
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:15,359
Don't

178
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,479
work too hard.

179
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,320
You'd better

180
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,359
cut down on alcohol.

181
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,840
Or I'll have to clean up your mess again.

182
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm just saying,

183
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,239
be careful with your words.

184
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,200
What?

185
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,200
Are you really in love with me?

186
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,039
Speaking of that,

187
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,200
I just remembered

188
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,199
I forgot my ID.

189
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,160
Out of my face!

190
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,360
Boss,

191
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,199
you really need to...

192
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:55,559
You've got to tag along.

193
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,439
You must go.

194
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:58,039
After all this time, you...

195
00:08:58,439 --> 00:08:58,919
Besides,

196
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,480
this time it's Yuhui who invited you.

197
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,439
You have to go, no matter what.

198
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,919
Just go, shall we?

199
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:04,360
I can't even do my work properly.

200
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,679
Really.

201
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,880
This time you must come with us.

202
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,439
If you don't go,

203
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:07,360
it's just not right.

204
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,799
Come on, come on!

205
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,880
Mr. Ji, we've been so busy with work,

206
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,319
right?

207
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:10,199
We've finally got a chance to

208
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:11,079
get together and build our relationships.

209
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,439
Let's have a drink for this.

210
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,280
Yuhui, I've already made the reservation.

211
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:19,880
Oh,

212
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,719
I just remembered

213
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,520
there's an email I still need to send.

214
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,559
I need to take care of it first.

215
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,719
I'll wait for you.

216
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:24,280
No problem.

217
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,120
You all go ahead.

218
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,079
Alright, Mr. Ji, see you later.

219
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,520
Take your time.

220
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,000
OK, later.

221
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,400
Hey.

222
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,679
We're still in the office.

223
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,760
Someone might see us.

224
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:42,000
There's no one around.

225
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,120
Are you alright?

226
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,240
I'm OK.

227
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,679
I'm just a bit tired.

228
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:49,959
I don't really feel like going out.

229
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,280
Then let's just head home.

230
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,679
We can order some beer,

231
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:53,880
get some fried chicken,

232
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,400
and watch a movie.

233
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,439
If you have anything to ask or vent about,

234
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,559
just share with me.

235
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,280
I don't have anything to vent about.

236
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,559
I failed on the project.

237
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,880
It's a reflection of my abilities.

238
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,839
I acknowledge that.

239
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,039
You should go have fun with them.

240
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,319
Being top in performance

241
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,760
is a recognition of your hard work.

242
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,799
You really should go.

243
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,719
But I don't want to

244
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:15,520
see you like this.

245
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,199
You failed once.

246
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,199
You must not

247
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,360
doubt yourself like this.

248
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,120
It's not just one time.

249
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,199
It's happened many times.

250
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,559
But that's OK.

251
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,439
I'm going shopping

252
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:32,360
with Ling Weiyi later.

253
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,240
We'll spend some money

254
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,360
on some happiness.

255
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,000
After all, I have

256
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,559
Mr. Ji's credit card.

257
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,199
Spend as much as you like.

258
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,240
I don't even need to know.

259
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,319
Just don't come home too late.

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,480
Be careful.

261
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,160
Don't worry.

262
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,120
Tomorrow we still have

263
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,240
to visit dad's grave, right?

264
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,120
You should come home early.

265
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,280
OK.

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,559
Off you go.

267
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,160
Go.

268
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Later.

269
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,919
- Let's go. - Why aren't you buying?

270
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:14,880
No need to buy them.

271
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,120
A pair won't amuse you for a month.

272
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,160
Maybe a week.

273
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,679
Three pairs might last twenty days.

274
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't spend that much on boots.

275
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,520
I still need to

276
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,319
remind you.

277
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,160
You're with Qi Yu now,

278
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,439
so you shouldn't spend that much.

279
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,039
You still need to

280
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,039
consider the feelings of us

281
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,520
ordinary folks, alright?

282
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,559
I did.

283
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:32,760
I go out with him and

284
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,679
I always take care of the bills secretly.

285
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,199
One sec.

286
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:45,520
Hello?

287
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,679
Aquarium?

288
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:49,839
What?

289
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,120
I was thinking of

290
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,160
having dinner with Xiaoning.

291
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,079
Why don't you come over?

292
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,919
Alright then.

293
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,160
Wait for me.

294
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,079
I'll be there soon.

295
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,039
He wanted me to go to

296
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,400
the aquarium all of a sudden.

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
Go ahead, eat by yourself.

298
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:10,360
I'll treat you another day.

299
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:10,799
OK.

300
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,160
Let me know when you get there.

301
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,319
Be safe on your way back.

302
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,199
See ya.

303
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,919
Weiyi,

304
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,360
my results are out.

305
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,719
Did you pass it?

306
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,919
You passed it, Qi Yu!

307
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,039
You really passed it!

308
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
That's amazing, Qi Yu!

309
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,120
I'm so happy for you!

310
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
I must get you a gift.

311
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,079
What should I get you?

312
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:49,559
Let me see.

313
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,079
How about a

314
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:51,600
motorcycle?

315
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,439
A watch?

316
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:53,919
Or maybe I can get you something you like,

317
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,400
like that

318
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,360
Chamberlain's personal basketball?

319
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,160
I don't need any of those.

320
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,360
Then what do you want?

321
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,600
Weiyi,

322
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,280
sunrise, starry sky, sunset.

323
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,360
I like all the things you like.

324
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,199
I want to watch them with you forever.

325
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,959
Once I secure the job,

326
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,039
let's go watch the sunrise together.

327
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,679
Is this

328
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,039
your proposal?

329
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,160
I might not say yes.

330
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:27,919
It depends on my mood.

331
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,400
Thank you for bringing me here.

332
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,360
Today is

333
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,799
a wonderful day for you.

334
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,199
Let's take a photo in here.

335
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:37,959
Come on,

336
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,199
let's record this moment of joy.

337
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:43,439
Yay!

338
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,319
You're up.

339
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,039
Where did you go early in the morning?

340
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,880
I went for a jog.

341
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,760
The physical fitness test for police has

342
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,640
become much stricter in recent years.

343
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:17,880
I need to train harder.

344
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,400
I have to take it seriously.

345
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:19,719
You sit

346
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:20,400
at work every day.

347
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:21,880
Let's go workout together.

348
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,719
I'm not going!

349
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,839
Then I'm heading out.

350
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,160
You just sleep in.

351
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm hungry.

352
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,480
Can you make some breakfast for me?

353
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,039
Alright.

354
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,799
Stop fooling around.

355
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,679
Wait for me to come back.

356
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,439
I'll bring you breakfast.

357
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,280
OK.

358
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,880
I'm off!

359
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,919
Fruits.

360
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:57,559
You're up.

361
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,079
Just in time.

362
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,799
See what I might have missed.

363
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,520
I've prepared liquor,

364
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,240
fruits, and pastries.

365
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,400
And then...

366
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:09,039
I forgot flowers!

367
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,120
No need to worry.

368
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,199
I bought flowers

369
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,039
last night.

370
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,079
They're in the trunk.

371
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,719
That won't do.

372
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,919
Mom said dad likes sunflowers.

373
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,400
I have to get sunflowers.

374
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,199
That's exactly what I got.

375
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,079
No need to worry.

376
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:22,600
Really?

377
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,799
Why are you so good?

378
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,919
If you didn't get them for me,

379
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,400
it would be so messed up.

380
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,760
I promised mom already.

381
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Why am I so good?

382
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Even though I'm this good,

383
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,039
someone still not wants

384
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:39,280
to tell me what's on her mind.

385
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,559
Hold still.

386
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,480
Let me recharge.

387
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,760
To be honest,

388
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,039
the shipyard case

389
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,880
and

390
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,199
Tang Yuhui getting promoted to

391
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,559
account manager ahead of me

392
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,280
has really hit me hard.

393
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,280
I might need some time

394
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,000
to process all these.

395
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,319
I don't even know why

396
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,039
these things

397
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,039
made me feel

398
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,719
so lacking in confidence right now.

399
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,240
I've been overshadowed by negativities.

400
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,439
But I believe I'll be OK.

401
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,679
Don't

402
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,360
you

403
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,839
look down on me.

404
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,679
You must not make fun of me either.

405
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:48,959
Come on,

406
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:56,600
how could I do that to you?

407
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,559
I just want to help you.

408
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,880
But I just

409
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,520
don't know how.

410
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,919
I'd love to support you

411
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:09,799
in regaining

412
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,079
your confidence,

413
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,919
so you could stop feeling down like this.

414
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,880
I understand.

415
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,000
It's dad.

416
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,799
OK,

417
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,719
I'll pack the stuff.

418
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,040
Hello, dad.

419
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Dad, mom!

420
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,560
You're here.

421
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,400
What happened?

422
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,439
They're operating on her now.

423
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,400
Last night, she went to bed

424
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,880
earlier than usual.

425
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,320
We thought

426
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,120
she wanted to get up early this morning

427
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,600
to wait for you to pick her up.

428
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,959
You planned to go to the cemetery, right?

429
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,479
So we didn't think much of it.

430
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,479
But when we got up this morning,

431
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,080
not long after,

432
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,080
she fainted.

433
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,919
It was my fault.

434
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:57,880
I should have

435
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,040
been more attentive.

436
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,759
Mom,

437
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,360
don't say that.

438
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:01,880
You got her here in time.

439
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,519
Doctor,

440
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:10,640
how is my mom doing?

441
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:11,719
Come to my office.

442
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,840
I'll explain everything to you.

443
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:13,999
Let's go.

444
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:14,239
OK.

445
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,919
I'm going.

446
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,719
Your mother's cancer cells

447
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:23,919
have spread significantly.

448
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,120
Based on the current symptoms,

449
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,999
they have started to spread to the brain.

450
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,800
The exact extent of the spread

451
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,199
will be determined after the test results

452
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:31,840
are available.

453
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,999
You have to prepare for the worst.

454
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,600
The patient isn't likely

455
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,560
to last much longer.

456
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:48,880
Doctor.

457
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,759
Not much longer?

458
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,800
How long does she have left?

459
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,199
Optimistically,

460
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,239
she has about one to two months.

461
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,519
One to two months?

462
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,400
Then,

463
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,519
can we switch

464
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,679
to other chemotherapy medications?

465
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,080
Starting radiation and chemotherapy now

466
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:15,600
won't do much good.

467
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,199
Moreover,

468
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:17,360
her condition

469
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,400
is not good enough for those.

470
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,120
Doctor Zhao,

471
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,199
please,

472
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,519
please figure

473
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,360
something out.

474
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,160
No matter how much it costs,

475
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,320
no matter what it takes,

476
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,239
I will cooperate fully.

477
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,199
We will do our utmost.

478
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,439
Xiaoning,

479
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,439
take these.

480
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,840
These are some meds mom often takes.

481
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,919
Tomorrow, when you're at the hospital,

482
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:06,600
just check with the doctor

483
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:07,840
which ones can be discontinued

484
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,040
and which ones should be kept going.

485
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,239
Aren't you going?

486
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:15,040
I have to go to Jinghai tomorrow.

487
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:16,959
It's regarding the loan for Zhouyang Hotel.

488
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,400
I've already been in touch with the

489
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,959
financial manager at their headquarters.

490
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:23,959
Zhouyang?

491
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,919
Wasn't that case assigned to section two?

492
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:27,279
Yes.

493
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,800
But they couldn't finalize the deal.

494
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,239
I happen to have some connections.

495
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,120
You're aiming to secure Zhouyang.

496
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,279
It won't be easy, though.

497
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,279
At the moment,

498
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,239
many banks are vying for it.

499
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
If you get involved with it,

500
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,800
you'll likely be

501
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,679
tied up for a long time.

502
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,999
Mom will be transferred out of ICU tomorrow.

503
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,719
The one she wants to see the most is you.

504
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,080
In my view,

505
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:02,519
you'd better spend more time with her.

506
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:07,759
I went to the hospital today.

507
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:09,800
The doctor told me that

508
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
there was a special medicine abroad.

509
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,320
Maybe it's effective for her.

510
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,160
But the cost of treatment

511
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,040
needs up to 800,000 RMB a year.

512
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,519
I have to make more money as soon as possible.

513
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,479
Can you come back before dinner?

514
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,160
I have to dine out with clients tonight.

515
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,719
Come back after midnight.

516
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,320
Door open.

517
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,560
Door locked.

518
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,840
It's good.

519
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:29,999
Tell Rao Jing

520
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:31,120
to take charge of it.

521
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:32,759
OK.

522
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:35,999
Mom...

523
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,999
she missed you,

524
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,519
and often talked about you these days.

525
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,880
Don't drink coffee anymore.

526
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:46,120
You've had three cups already.

527
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,560
Don't worry.

528
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,320
I refresh myself with it.

529
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,040
I promise you this is the last one.

530
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,719
You lost flesh

531
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:53,759
these days,

532
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,800
and have quite black circles.

533
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,279
You can't be like this anymore.

534
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,880
It's bad for your health.

535
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,400
Come in.

536
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,800
Director Ji,

537
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:07,439
Hello, Xiaoning.

538
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,479
What's up?

539
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,360
Brother,

540
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,479
I heard your mom was in hospital.

541
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,600
Could you tell me which hospital?

542
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,400
I can ask my friends

543
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,439
to help

544
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,080
to take care of her.

545
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,360
Thank you for your concern.

546
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:25,479
I've got everything arranged.

547
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:27,080
So...

548
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,759
I'd better

549
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,719
buy some gifts for her.

550
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,600
I appreciate your kindness.

551
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,519
But her medical condition is not good.

552
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,239
The doctor said she needed a quiet environment.

553
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,279
You're responsible

554
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,040
for several clients.

555
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,160
I hope you can make some progress

556
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,999
until the regular meeting next week.

557
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,040
So I'm leaving, sir.

558
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,160
The project will be

559
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,040
formally examined and approved

560
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,360
next week.

561
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:53,560
Good.

562
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,279
So...

563
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:57,080
that's it.

564
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,800
OK.

565
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,560
Xiaoning,

566
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,279
I'll give you

567
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,080
some clients' information.

568
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,880
You need to compile it into a report presented at the meeting.

569
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:21,919
By the way,

570
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,479
you need to finish it tonight.

571
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,880
Me?

572
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:26,759
Why?

573
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,719
You assist Jing in doing the project, too.

574
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,080
She's the manager.

575
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,400
So am I now.

576
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,880
As an assistant,

577
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,560
that's your job.

578
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,400
I suppose you might be wrong.

579
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:37,959
Jing is my master.

580
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:38,919
I should

581
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:39,759
obey her instructions.

582
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,600
But I don't need to

583
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,519
obey yours.

584
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,080
Didn't you hear

585
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,479
what brother said?

586
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,800
He said

587
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,320
I should focus on the project.

588
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,479
I heard it.

589
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,880
Then do it.

590
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,160
I have faith in you.

591
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,040
Well done.

592
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,279
She served that

593
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,880
right.

594
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,840
Tomorrow I'll tell the property company

595
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,160
to demagnetize her time card.

596
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,880
I guarantee you that

597
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,959
she'll be late for over an hour.

598
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:18,800
Don't do that.

599
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,800
I can deal with her.

600
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,160
I don't like

601
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,919
her arrogance.

602
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,360
In fact,

603
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,320
she's good at dealing with clients.

604
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,080
She drew tens of millions of deposits,

605
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,479
and made lending to big business.

606
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,959
She did very well.

607
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,840
As for me,

608
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
I even couldn't

609
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,800
see through

610
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,919
a shipyard owner's trick.

611
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,679
I thought

612
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,080
I could make a deal with that man.

613
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:43,120
He hid his real purpose from you.

614
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,439
It's reasonable that

615
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,840
you didn't know

616
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,439
what went wrong.

617
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,880
The past is past.

618
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,560
Don't let it keep haunting you.

619
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,360
I got it.

620
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,160
I'm just at a loss.

621
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,439
When I worked in the bank lobby,

622
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,519
there was a lot of trivial work to do.

623
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,560
The salary was low.

624
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,560
I had to deal with rude clients

625
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,400
everyday.

626
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:07,239
Sometimes

627
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,120
I was pushed into a corner.

628
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,679
Then I went to the Business Development Department.

629
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,679
I was anxious about getting my permanent employeeship,

630
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,160
and about performance.

631
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
I was even overwhelmed

632
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,239
by the task index.

633
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,560
Like me,

634
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,439
a lot of colleagues were so anxious that

635
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,759
they suffered from insomnia and alopecia.

636
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,400
I thought

637
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:25,880
the effort was not

638
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,640
proportional to the return.

639
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,120
But it's what it is.

640
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,999
The bank is like a Fortress Besieged.

641
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:33,840
Outsiders reckon

642
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,959
working in it is decent.

643
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,919
However,

644
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,959
quite the opposite

645
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
is true.

646
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,320
I have been working there for four years.

647
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,719
I didn't see my bright future ahead.

648
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,080
I've

649
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,120
lost my way

650
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,400
to the future.

651
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,239
You are right.

652
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,679
But Ji Yuheng

653
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,080
came into your life.

654
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,080
It offsets your career predicament.

655
00:28:58,999 --> 00:28:59,519
There always exists a natural balance

656
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,199
between good and bad.

657
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,199
Yes.

658
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,479
He was very busy lately.

659
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,959
He worked hard to make money

660
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,600
to afford the special medicine.

661
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:09,439
But

662
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,160
I had asked the doctor about it.

663
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,479
He said

664
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,160
it was not so effective for her.

665
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:16,959
Did he know that?

666
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,479
I'm sure

667
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,840
he did.

668
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,199
I know

669
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,479
what he thought.

670
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,239
Even though

671
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,600
the medicine couldn't cure his mom,

672
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,080
he would rather

673
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,840
have a try.

674
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,439
I can do nothing

675
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,959
for him

676
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,080
except

677
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:34,439
taking care of mom.

678
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,279
But you should

679
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,279
take care of yourself well.

680
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,040
You lost weight these days.

681
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,279
I'll order you a take-out

682
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,120
you like best

683
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,360
and deliver it to the hospital.

684
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,040
Thank you.

685
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,239
I'm sorry.

686
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,519
I'm so careless.

687
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,239
That's all right.

688
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,279
Ms Cai,

689
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
you have been here for the whole day.

690
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,679
You'd better get some rest.

691
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,040
Ms Cai,

692
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:10,239
have some rest.

693
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:10,959
I'll take care of her.

694
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,880
OK.

695
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:12,999
Thank you.

696
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,759
It's OK.

697
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,719
Mom.

698
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:19,840
How you doing?

699
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:20,759
Did she make you hurt?

700
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,479
She's a good daughter-in-law

701
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,400
who cares about you so much.

702
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,439
Are you hungry?

703
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,120
My mom cooked some fish soup,

704
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,919
which is warmed

705
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,360
in the canteen.

706
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,400
I'll get it for you.

707
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,360
No, thank you.

708
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Xiaoning,

709
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,279
Ms Cai can take care of me.

710
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,999
Your mom often visited me.

711
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,840
Don't worry about me.

712
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Tell my son that

713
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm OK.

714
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,880
He doesn't feel at ease.

715
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,959
He's worried about you every day.

716
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,199
But

717
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,120
he has been tied up in

718
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
business.

719
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,519
He couldn't spare time for you.

720
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,800
So don't blame him.

721
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,439
I won't.

722
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,160
I understand that.

723
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,360
What's more,

724
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,560
I don't want him

725
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:17,800
to see me like this.

726
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,880
I'm worried

727
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,919
he would be more upset than I am.

728
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,199
Mom,

729
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,479
I need to take the phone call.

730
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,560
OK, go ahead.

731
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,999
Keep warm.

732
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,400
Hello, Fanggang.

733
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,160
What's up?

734
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,759
It's the client of the garden area

735
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:51,880
you got in touch with.

736
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,239
He has a good impression on you.

737
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,239
He agreed to let you take on the project.

738
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,479
Thank you for telling me this.

739
00:31:59,239 --> 00:31:59,759
Are you all right?

740
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,719
You didn't sound excited.

741
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,040
I'm pleased.

742
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:05,999
OK.

743
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,120
I'm going to send you the details.

744
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:07,919
You'd better look it through

745
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,040
as soon as possible.

746
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,160
Then I will arrange a client meeting for you.

747
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,279
OK.

748
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,400
Bye-bye.

749
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,600
Bye-bye.

750
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,320
You have to

751
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,439
give up the project.

752
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,560
Mr. Yang had been in jail.

753
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,040
He has a criminal record.

754
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,360
It was rumored that

755
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,160
he didn't want to take out a loan.

756
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,880
That's not true.

757
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,719
He was banned from doing that.

758
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,919
As a customer manager,

759
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,239
if we don't have

760
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,759
such occupational sensitivity,

761
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,999
we are

762
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,120
incapable of this job.

763
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,120
So

764
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,320
you need to develop other projects.

765
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:43,360
Cheer up!

766
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,360
Door open.

767
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,479
Why didn't you sleep?

768
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm looking up some information,

769
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,239
and waiting for you.

770
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,040
Go to bed now.

771
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I want to talk to you.

772
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
I'm a little tired.

773
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,360
We can talk another day.

774
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,080
No.

775
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,400
That's why I'm waiting for you.

776
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,519
We have to talk now.

777
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,800
Let go of me.

778
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:17,600
Don't...

779
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,880
I want a recharge.

780
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,319
Why did you give up the project?

781
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:46,679
Do you have new clients?

782
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,839
No.

783
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,960
I don't have much experience.

784
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,279
So

785
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,679
I gave it up.

786
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,080
But you can accumulate experience

787
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,040
step by step.

788
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
If you have any difficulty,

789
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,160
Jing and I

790
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,879
can help you.

791
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,799
I get it, Fanggang.

792
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:03,359
I...

793
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,279
Someone in my family

794
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:07,839
is in hospital.

795
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,120
I have to take care of her.

796
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:10,679
So

797
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:11,920
I can't spare extra time and energy

798
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,080
for the project.

799
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:14,640
That's why

800
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,879
I can't take on the project.

801
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,399
But thank you all the same.

802
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:20,920
I need to make a phone call.

803
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:31,920
What happened?

804
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,839
Xiaoning needs performance to a get permanent employeeship.

805
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,960
I wanted to introduce a client to her.

806
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:40,839
Did she decline it?

807
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:42,960
She said

808
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,319
her family member

809
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,160
was in hospital

810
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:46,080
and needed to be taken care of.

811
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,839
I understand that.

812
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,679
Xiaoning is smart

813
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:50,640
and works hard.

814
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,080
This is a chance for her.

815
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,199
I'll talk to her

816
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,560
again.

817
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,920
Tang told me that

818
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,120
someone in your family

819
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,199
was in hospital.

820
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,160
It's my mom.

821
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,799
Her medical condition is not good.

822
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:11,120
It's all right.

823
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:11,679
Let's go.

824
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:23,000
I got some coffee at a discount.

825
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,040
Buy one, and get one for free.

826
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,160
I picked them out at random.

827
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,199
Manager Zhao,

828
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,480
could you not talk with me

829
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,359
face to back?

830
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:33,879
OK.

831
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,799
It's my favorite flavor.

832
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:39,759
Is it for free?

833
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:42,960
You don't like it?

834
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:43,799
Take it away.

835
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,120
Try it.

836
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:45,799
I'm scared.

837
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:46,759
Scared of what?

838
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:48,080
Claim an interest from me.

839
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,040
Neither you nor Xiaoning

840
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,440
accepted my help.

841
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,000
She declined my client offer.

842
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,080
You refused my coffee.

843
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,480
Both of you failed me.

844
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,920
Did you give her a client?

845
00:36:59,199 --> 00:36:59,719
What's wrong?

846
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:01,600
We worked

847
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,319
from the grounds.

848
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,600
She worked in the bank lobby for three years.

849
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,679
and failed to get the permanent employeeship.

850
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,960
The effort didn't pay off.

851
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,799
Then she was transferred here.

852
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,120
She intended to start from scratch.

853
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,279
Unexpectedly,

854
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:13,279
she competed with her old rival,

855
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,040
and hasn't taken the permanent employeeship yet.

856
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,239
Now

857
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,080
she's suspicious of

858
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:18,080
her career

859
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,199
and capacity.

860
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,399
It's out of your kindness

861
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,319
to help her.

862
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:22,239
But she didn't think about it that way.

863
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,719
You just hit her confidence,

864
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,399
don't you?

865
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,199
I thought

866
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:28,440
you didn't care about her

867
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,839
at all.

868
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:31,199
I didn't expect

869
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,199
you knew her so much.

870
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,719
I did.

871
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,759
I know everything.

872
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,520
Do you mind

873
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,560
warmth to me?

874
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,080
What did you say?

875
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,600
I said

876
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,399
your

877
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,440
warmth to me.

878
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,799
That would get you in trouble.

879
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:56,759
Anything else?

880
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,679
I...

881
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,480
I have something

882
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,199
to tell you.

883
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,879
The director's mom is in hospital.

884
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,799
So I plan to

885
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:03,960
gather colleagues

886
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:05,120
to visit her.

887
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,920
I heard

888
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:07,000
his mother was sick.

889
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,359
I agree with you.

890
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm certain

891
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,600
everybody will

892
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:12,759
respond to

893
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,920
your call.

894
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,040
You don't have to

895
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,520
talk about it with me,

896
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,560
right?

897
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,440
Fanggang,

898
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,480
why did you always

899
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
tell Jing everything first?

900
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:26,279
Manager Zhao,

901
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,160
what are you thinking of?

902
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,600
Nothing.

903
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,399
So

904
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,480
I get the coffee.

905
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:35,560
It can be the payoff

906
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,600
of the consultation.

907
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,920
Thank you.

908
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,560
Where are you going?

909
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:43,279
None of your business.

910
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:01,799
Who is it?

911
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,480
You again!

912
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,759
I told you

913
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,399
it's not the visiting period.

914
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,799
Get out of here.

915
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,480
Come early next time.

916
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't go in.

917
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:12,799
I just stay here for a while.

918
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,279
Did you have alcohol?

919
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,120
You'd better not go crazy here.

920
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,759
I'll leave in a few minutes.

921
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:20,799
Thank you.

922
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:26,879
Mom,

923
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
it has been almost ten years.

924
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:31,839
It's not easy for us

925
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,600
to have an intact family.

926
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,600
I don't want to lose it.

927
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,799
Please, give me more time.

928
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,719
Door open.

929
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,600
Why didn't you go to bed?

930
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,839
Did you drink again?

931
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,480
The financial representatives of Zhouyang

932
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,879
came here to inspect business.

933
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
It was a rare chance to dine with them.

934
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:11,839
So

935
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:12,759
I had to drink with them.

936
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:16,319
Mom is

937
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,759
missing you very much.

938
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,040
She hadn't seen you

939
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,879
for a week.

940
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:21,960
But she didn't

941
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:23,759
tell me.

942
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,040
I don't want to talk about it now.

943
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,160
Why didn't you

944
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,199
go to her?

945
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,879
You can't avoid the reality.

946
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,120
So you think

947
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
I don't want to face it.

948
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:42,000
Mom is in critical condition.

949
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,319
It doesn't help

950
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:44,000
even if I go to visit her.

951
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,799
I need to earn more money

952
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,679
to let her

953
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,679
take the special medicine.

954
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,120
She needs you

955
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,199
more than the special medicine.

956
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,399
Can you

957
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,279
stay with her more

958
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,000
in her last few months?

959
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,759
Don't make yourself regret about it.

960
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:57,239
Tu Xiaoning,

961
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,759
what do you mean?

962
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
I won't

963
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,759
let her die.

964
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,040
I'll keep her alive.

965
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,920
Don't lie to yourself.

966
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:09,719
You hate to face mom's medical condition

967
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,759
and the worst outcome.

968
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,920
You just

969
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
escape from reality

970
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,879
everyday.

971
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:16,679
In fact,

972
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,679
you just make excuses for yourself.

973
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,560
Yes,

974
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,920
you're right.

975
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,440
But what about you?

976
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,440
Zhao Fanggang intended to introduce a client to you.

977
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,080
Why did you refuse him?

978
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,879
You failed to deal with the project of the shipyard,

979
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,120
then you

980
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
lost confidence,

981
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,279
right?

982
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:33,839
You'd better

983
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:34,520
mind your own business first.

984
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,399
So you don't mind

985
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:39,960
being an assistant,

986
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,679
and failing to pass the assessment

987
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,679
of permanent employeeship.

988
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,719
I don't mind.

989
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:38,960
Ji Yuheng,

990
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:42,440
Don't bring your bad mood back home.

991
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,279
She's under a lot of pressure, too.

992
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,839
Door open.

993
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:17,120
Why didn't you sleep?

994
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:18,679
I'm looking up some information,

995
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,960
and waiting for you.

996
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,679
Go to bed now.

997
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:23,799
I want to talk to you.

998
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,480
I'm a little tired.

999
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,080
We can talk another day.

1000
00:43:26,399 --> 00:43:26,920
No.

1001
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,239
That's why I'm waiting for you.

1002
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,239
We have to talk now.

1003
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:41,080
Let go of me.

1004
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:41,759
Don't...

1005
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,279
I want a recharge.
