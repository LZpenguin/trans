1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,160
You Are My Secret EP05

3
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,759
Is everyone here?

4
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,520
Yeah, everyone's here.

5
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,799
The meeting's over.

6
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,199
What's that supposed to mean?

7
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,000
Beats me.

8
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,120
Let's go.

9
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:02,879
Seriously,

10
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,919
this guy is odd.

11
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,039
To prevent

12
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,120
this from happening again,

13
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,840
I'll add everyone

14
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,000
on WeChat,

15
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,720
and I'll set up a work group

16
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,799
so that it gets the attention of everyone.

17
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
If anyone's late

18
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,879
or leaves early again,

19
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,079
I'll leave it to

20
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,120
company rules to decide.

21
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,079
Meeting dismissed.

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,199
This VIP is quite something,

23
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,799
really knows how to put on airs.

24
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,079
Looks all harmless

25
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,319
like a sheep,

26
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,479
but just now

27
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:01,720
acted more like

28
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
a big bad wolf.

29
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,319
I didn't expect

30
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,879
to get so freaked out

31
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,840
by a little name badge

32
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,520
on our first day

33
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,639
of secret dating.

34
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:18,160
Really?

35
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,599
Xiaoning,

36
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,319
you seemed pretty chill,

37
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,919
especially at the convenience store.

38
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,039
You were super quick to react.

39
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,319
No way,

40
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,560
I almost tripped.

41
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,079
We need

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,199
to stay alert

43
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,039
in this

44
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,639
kind of relationship with you,

45
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,200
always...

46
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:40,919
Be on our toes...

47
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,599
Right.

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,119
Mr. Ji,

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,239
how's your first day

50
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,200
in the BDD?

51
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,160
What's your impression?

52
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,999
Honestly,

53
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,400
on this first day,

54
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,200
I feel like there are quite a few issues

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,840
that to be sorted out.

56
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,679
Is it about the colleagues?

57
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:03,479
Don't move,

58
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll wash the dishes today,

59
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,039
and handle the housework.

60
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,039
From now on, I'll do it on

61
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,400
Mon, Wed, and Fri. The rest is yours.

62
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,960
On Sundays, we both rest.

63
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,640
Clear division of labor,

64
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,599
clear boundaries.

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,599
Do we need boundaries after work?

66
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,200
Yes, we do.

67
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,039
This way, if something happens,

68
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,359
it's muscle memory,

69
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,359
and it won't be obvious to others.

70
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,280
Makes sense.

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,039
So today, you wash the dishes,

72
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,039
I'll clean up.

73
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,039
Sure,

74
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:31,919
I got it.

75
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,039
What's wrong?

76
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:38,999
Nothing,

77
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,520
my new shoes rubbing a bit.

78
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,599
It'll be fine in a couple of days.

79
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,320
Here, let me.

80
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,119
There you go.

81
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:24,880
Thanks?

82
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,039
So, what happened next?

83
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,400
Nothing.

84
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,280
Nothing?

85
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,760
You look exhausted.

86
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,880
Ling Weiyi,

87
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,799
if your brain

88
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,840
had a screen,

89
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,239
it'd be covered with mosaics.

90
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,439
What are you thinking?

91
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,280
By "nothing," I mean

92
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,400
he went to his room,

93
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,880
I went to mine.

94
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,119
We're good, no interruptions.

95
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,999
Tu Xiaoning,

96
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,200
are you monks

97
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,439
in spiritual practice?

98
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,960
If you're serious,

99
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:22,880
you need to

100
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,799
check everything out about him,

101
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:25,599
and the most important thing

102
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,200
is physical chemistry.

103
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,599
We're eating,

104
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:30,799
can you stop

105
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:31,679
with the dirty talk?

106
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,039
I'm just trying to help.

107
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,799
I asked you here

108
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,520
to get your opinion.

109
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,359
At this stage,

110
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,239
is it normal

111
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
for this to happen

112
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:44,599
between us?

113
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,320
Not normal,

114
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,239
not at all.

115
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,760
You've already kissed,

116
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,119
why not take it further

117
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,080
while things are hot?

118
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:53,799
You might

119
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,039
end up with

120
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,880
some fiery passion,

121
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,000
a romantic evening,

122
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:00,160
and unforgettable moments.

123
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:03,919
Such a waste, really.

124
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,799
Our department's first meeting

125
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,799
will be held this morning.

126
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,360
Sorry, I have to go.

127
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,120
Duty calls.

128
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,079
Can't stay for your lecture.

129
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,679
Next time.

130
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,360
Always in a rush.

131
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,600
Don't forget to finish these

132
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,640
before your meeting.

133
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,000
Didn't those shoes rub your feet?

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,919
Why are you still wearing them?

135
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,039
They're fine now.

136
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,319
They've softened up.

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:24,919
See you.

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,000
Mr. Ji,

139
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,120
I currently

140
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,439
have

141
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,039
12 clients,

142
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,439
90% of them

143
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,760
are small private businesses,

144
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,600
and they're

145
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,760
all repaying as planned.

146
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,319
Mr. Ji,

147
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,799
I have 10 clients,

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,520
and my goal is to increase the deposit

149
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,199
by 15% by the end

150
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,079
of the first quarter next year.

151
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,160
I have 5 clients,

152
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,959
aiming to boost the volume of deposits

153
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,000
by 10%

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,400
in the first quarter next year.

155
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,919
Mr. Ji,

156
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,559
I have 9 clients,

157
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,400
80% are small businesses,

158
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,079
and 20%t are medium-sized.

159
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,000
My goal is to increase the number of

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
medium and large business clients

161
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,000
by 15% by next year.

162
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,760
I have

163
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,559
32 clients,

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,520
60% are small businesses,

165
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,959
30% are

166
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,199
medium to large clients,

167
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,000
and 10% are government-related.

168
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:15,959
My goal for the first quarter next year

169
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,319
is to increase derived deposits

170
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:18,799
by 30%.

171
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,760
30%, huh?

172
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,600
That's pretty ambitious.

173
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,799
We still need to review

174
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,079
the interest costs and composite returns

175
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,959
of our current clients.

176
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Starting from the coming week,

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,799
I'll go visit them one by one with you.

178
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,400
All right.

179
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,520
Manager Zhao,

180
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,160
you have 18 clients,

181
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,799
80% government,

182
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:43,439
and 20% private.

183
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,600
What are your

184
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,400
career plans?

185
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,959
My plan is to grow

186
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,480
and excel in my role

187
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,600
as a client manager.

188
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:52,520
With just 18 clients?

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,240
I think it's quite a lot.

190
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,160
Mr. Ji,

191
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,839
you're new to the BDD,

192
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,160
so you might not know.

193
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:02,199
Government-related clients

194
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,839
bring more deposits,

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,199
which is the most practical.

196
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,120
The government is heavily

197
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,600
supporting private enterprises now,

198
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,000
and all banks

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,439
are making structural transformation.

200
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:13,280
Given this trend, you have

201
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,799
only 4 private businesses,

202
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,400
and 1 is a bad loan.

203
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:19,240
Are you happy with that?

204
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,199
I think it's fine.

205
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,400
All right,

206
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,839
I'll work harder.

207
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,120
"Working harder" is something

208
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,480
you say to yourself.

209
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:30,880
I'm result-oriented.

210
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,679
I'll go out and visit clients

211
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,039
right after the meeting.

212
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,520
From this month on, add 1 new

213
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,160
private business client each month.

214
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:43,400
I'll try my best.

215
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,839
Is 1 client a month

216
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,439
really that hard for you?

217
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,079
Mr. Ji,

218
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,719
whatever you say,

219
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,640
I'll do.

220
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,959
Tu Xiaoning,

221
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,520
what business

222
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,799
are you handling now?

223
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,799
Corporate admissions,

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,480
ratings,

225
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,799
bank drafts,

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,880
domestic letters of credit,

227
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,400
and discount processes.

228
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,719
I'm asking about your business,

229
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,799
not processes.

230
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,000
If you can't complete

231
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,520
the necessary business assessments

232
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,280
within six months,

233
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,400
someone else

234
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,439
will take your place.

235
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:34,480
Got it, Mr. Ji.

236
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,919
You wanted to be

237
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,880
treated equally.

238
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:42,839
Don't mess up, Tu Xiaoning.

239
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,319
Hi,

240
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,400
can you tell me

241
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,360
how to get to

242
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,559
the loan department

243
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,679
at Bank of Dairui?

244
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,919
Do you have an appointment?

245
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,039
My friend works here.

246
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,039
I came to meet him.

247
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,959
I called,

248
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,839
but he didn't answer.

249
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,719
Can I

250
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:05,600
go up and wait for him?

251
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,160
Sorry,

252
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,760
our policy requires visitors

253
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,160
to be escorted.

254
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,760
Please wait

255
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,799
in the lounge.

256
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,360
Okay, thanks.

257
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,079
Security!

258
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,679
The man in black is breaking in!

259
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,199
That meeting

260
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:39,240
made me so mad.

261
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,319
Me too.

262
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,839
Zhao's so patient.

263
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,600
If it were me,

264
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,919
I'd have flipped the table.

265
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,520
Excuse me,

266
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,839
does your

267
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:51,439
department handle

268
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,559
Dairui's loan projects?

269
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,400
I have a query.

270
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,719
Hold on, please.

271
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,959
We don't handle

272
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,280
external business here.

273
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,160
You need to go to

274
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,360
the main hall,

275
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,919
get a number,

276
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,319
and wait.

277
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,760
Also, now isn't a good time.

278
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:05,160
Yes.

279
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,839
Try later.

280
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:09,919
You always say

281
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,679
there's no time,

282
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,319
but you have time now, don't you?

283
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,160
No...

284
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,360
what are you doing?

285
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,760
No, this time...

286
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,120
You... sir...

287
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,280
please calm down.

288
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,679
Let's talk.

289
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,439
Put the knife down.

290
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,959
The time for talking is over!

291
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,160
You... put the knife...

292
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,360
Has anyone even listened to me?

293
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:25,919
Xiaoning?

294
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,600
Hello, sir.

295
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,079
I'm Tu Xiaoning, an assistant

296
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,679
client manager.

297
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,400
Here's my badge.

298
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,000
What can I help you with?

299
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:34,719
You can tell me.

300
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,439
I'll do my best

301
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:36,160
to assist you.

302
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,039
We all will.

303
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,280
Yes, yes.

304
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:39,839
Qianliyuan.

305
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,839
Qianliyuan?

306
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,919
Qianliyuan introduced me

307
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,719
to an

308
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,959
88,000 yuan dating loan.

309
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,000
I gave the money

310
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,240
to my girlfriend

311
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,719
from Qianliyuan,

312
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,079
and she

313
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,520
ran off with it.

314
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,679
Now your bank

315
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,839
wants me to repay the loan.

316
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,760
It's unfair.

317
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,760
Why should I pay for the money

318
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,959
she took and ran away with?

319
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,240
Qianliyuan,

320
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,240
I know.

321
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,799
A dating company.

322
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:11,760
Yes,

323
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,959
they guaranteed

324
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,240
the loan,

325
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,799
which is why I took it.

326
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:17,679
Sir,

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
this loan was arranged

328
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,640
by Qianliyuan...

329
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,039
You...

330
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,319
When you convinced me to take the loan,

331
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,760
everything sounded perfect.

332
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:24,719
Now that there's an issue,

333
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,679
you don't care?

334
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,360
No, we won't ignore it.

335
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,439
We will never turn a blind eye.

336
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,199
I'm going to

337
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,839
die here today

338
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,679
to show you!

339
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,880
Show you all!

340
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,199
Calm down, calm down!

341
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,719
Cool it, man!

342
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,000
Call the police, get security.

343
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,600
All right.

344
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,400
Stay safe.

345
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:38,919
I will.

346
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,839
Don't rush.

347
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,039
This may take some time.

348
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:41,959
Please put the knife down,

349
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,679
and let's talk.

350
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,400
You...

351
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,480
you

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
cancel it

353
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,240
right now!

354
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,039
Cancel it immediately!

355
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:51,679
Okay, okay!

356
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,079
Do you

357
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,719
remember your

358
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,120
loan contract number?

359
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll find it for you

360
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,280
right now.

361
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Contract number?

362
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,360
Contract number...

363
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,719
It's okay if you don't remember.

364
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,919
We can use facial recognition.

365
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,480
Just look at this camera

366
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,959
for the scan.

367
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:14,919
Right.

368
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,959
Look here.

369
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,160
Over here.

370
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,719
Scammers!

371
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,240
You're scammers!

372
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,919
You're all scammers!

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
All of you!

374
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,880
Security!

375
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,799
Take him down!

376
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,679
You're bleeding.

377
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,199
It's okay.

378
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,319
Are you all right?

379
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,439
Xiaoning,

380
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,480
you really are a hero.

381
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,919
That was impressive.

382
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,079
No, it was thanks to Ji...

383
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,719
Mr. Ji.

384
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,199
Luckily,

385
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,719
he acted quickly.

386
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:16,280
It was indeed

387
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,120
a dangerous situation.

388
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,839
I wanted to help too,

389
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,559
but I wasn't there.

390
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:20,880
But

391
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,360
you shouldn't side with him

392
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,400
just because of this incident.

393
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,120
Who is related to Ji Yuheng?

394
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,360
Doctor, how is he?

395
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,479
The wound is not deep,

396
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,919
but it's quite large.

397
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,439
We've done initial treatment,

398
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,719
but he needs proper rest.

399
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,519
During recovery,

400
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,679
he shouldn't eat spicy food,

401
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:36,919
and the wound mustn't get wet.

402
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:42,519
Why are you here?

403
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,160
How are you?

404
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,880
I'm fine.

405
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,719
You've got a lot of guts.

406
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,759
Aren't you afraid they'll find out?

407
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,959
Let me see your hand.

408
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,080
It's nothing.

409
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,279
Really,

410
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,080
what if he had used more force

411
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,719
and seriously

412
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:01,320
injured you?

413
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,160
Better me than you.

414
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,040
I'm a man;

415
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,040
a little injury is nothing.

416
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,239
But you,

417
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,439
I haven't even asked you yet.

418
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,679
Why did you step in

419
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,959
while the others were backing out?

420
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,600
I've been in the lobby for three years.

421
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,600
I've seen this kind of thing a lot.

422
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,880
It's become a natural reaction.

423
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,999
I'm used to it.

424
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,719
What did the doctor say?

425
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,479
Do you need to stay for observation?

426
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,560
Are you still in pain?

427
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,479
No pain,

428
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,679
just need an IV drip.

429
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,320
A few hours

430
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,919
of observation should be enough.

431
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,040
All right.

432
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,919
How's his situation?

433
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,320
Jing called the police.

434
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,719
He should have been taken away.

435
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,360
If they

436
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,959
go back to the company,

437
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,320
I'll go with them

438
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,880
and find a chance to return later.

439
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,400
No need,

440
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,959
it's work time.

441
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,439
Don't you remember the agreement

442
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:57,999
we signed last night?

443
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,040
Mr. Ji.

444
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,600
Is your arm okay?

445
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,840
It's fine.

446
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,439
The doctor has already taken care of it.

447
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:23,560
That's good to hear.

448
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,679
Where's Xiaoning?

449
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,519
She was

450
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,519
just with us.

451
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:34,679
Right,

452
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:36,479
let me call her.

453
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,640
Is Xiaoning here too?

454
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:58,479
She's not answering.

455
00:19:58,959 --> 00:19:59,519
Maybe she went back

456
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,439
to the company.

457
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,519
Then we should

458
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,320
head back too.

459
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,239
The doctor said

460
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,320
you need to stay for observation.

461
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,759
Manager Rao, you go back first,

462
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,519
and Manager Zhao will stay with me.

463
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,600
Fine.

464
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:45,759
Want to have a drink tonight?

465
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,519
I'm not as carefree as you guys.

466
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh, I bought an Americano and a latte.

467
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,519
Which one do you want?

468
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,640
Latte, please.

469
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,439
Latte, here you go.

470
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,439
You should head back.

471
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,400
All right,

472
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,239
I'll go.

473
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,199
Why did she come to the hospital?

474
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,560
Are you okay?

475
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,439
Are you okay? Were you scared just now?

476
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,239
A bit, yeah.

477
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,919
Must have seen a lot of troublemakers

478
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,999
working in the lobby before, right?

479
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,800
It's rare to see someone with a knife.

480
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,239
True.

481
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Consider it an eye-opener.

482
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,400
But you were too reckless just now.

483
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,679
And

484
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,880
you shouldn't have shown him

485
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,560
your badge.

486
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,560
What if

487
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,759
he filed a complaint

488
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:43,999
and you lost your job?

489
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:44,959
You haven't even been confirmed yet.

490
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,519
I didn't think that far.

491
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,239
I just wanted to help solve the problem.

492
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,959
So, what happened

493
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,239
to Gao?

494
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,360
It's up to the police.

495
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,080
But he really

496
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,160
shouldn't have pulled a knife,

497
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,959
no matter how impulsive he was.

498
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,959
And Mr. Ji,

499
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,400
he's new to our department

500
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:03,880
and acted too impulsively too.

501
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,439
What if

502
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,040
he had been seriously hurt?

503
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,120
Who would take responsibility?

504
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,919
Jing,

505
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
what is this dating loan?

506
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,199
I didn't know our bank

507
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,719
offered such a service.

508
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,479
The dating loan

509
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,279
is a term

510
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,040
created by

511
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,759
the matchmaking service providers

512
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,719
in the past couple of years,

513
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,560
similar to

514
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
our bank's

515
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,239
consumer loans.

516
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,999
It was handled by Manager Jiang before.

517
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
But Manager Jiang

518
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,239
has been fired, right?

519
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
Yes, but he

520
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,479
wasn't the

521
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:37,519
only one

522
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,560
involved in this business.

523
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Consumer loans are a legitimate business

524
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,719
promoted by the head office,

525
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,360
not illegal or against the rules.

526
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,160
As for what customers do with the money,

527
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,600
getting married or funerals,

528
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,759
that's their business.

529
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,560
Consumer loans

530
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,160
are legitimate,

531
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:54,959
but that doesn't mean

532
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:55,959
there were no irregularities

533
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,279
in the process.

534
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,199
Did you

535
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:00,519
fully understand the customers'

536
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,279
needs and situations

537
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,080
and have you explained

538
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,519
the contract terms?

539
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,880
To make it even worse,

540
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,800
if someone

541
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,279
secretly collaborated

542
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,719
with matchmaking platforms

543
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,080
to deceive

544
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,600
or induce borrowers

545
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,719
to take loans,

546
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,560
like today's case

547
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,279
and took kickbacks...

548
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:22,479
Mr. Ji,

549
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,320
you can't just say that.

550
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,360
It was approved by Manager Jiang,

551
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,479
He brought in the lenders.

552
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:28,519
I was just

553
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,320
doing the legwork.

554
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,320
You can't

555
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,759
pin this on me.

556
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,239
I'm not saying it's you.

557
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,080
But Manager Zhao,

558
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,360
as the handler,

559
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,800
you need to clear your name

560
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,199
by thoroughly investigating

561
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,040
this matter.

562
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,959
Are you not up for it?

563
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,679
Mr. Ji,

564
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,199
you just

565
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:56,519
joined us

566
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,560
and haven't been here long

567
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,999
so you might not understand

568
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,040
that dealing with people

569
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,199
in everyday life

570
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,519
inevitably involves complications,

571
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:03,640
especially when we're

572
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,199
dealing with

573
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:05,840
other people's money.

574
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,400
It's commonplace

575
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,719
to run into

576
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:10,999
some unreasonable pricks.

577
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
If you want clarity on everything,

578
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
we shouldn't bother working our asses off.

579
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,840
Should just go be a cop.

580
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,279
Alright, answer me this.

581
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,199
Is this so called

582
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,080
"blind date loan"

583
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,160
issued from our bank

584
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:24,519
an isolated case?

585
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,040
If there's a

586
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,959
massive blow-up,

587
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,719
the Main Branch will step in.

588
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,560
Then this

589
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:35,919
stops being

590
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,120
a problem between us.

591
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:49,279
Fine.

592
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,560
You want me to investigate?

593
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:53,959
Let's do it then.

594
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,719
You stay here and rest.

595
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm off.

596
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,320
Hey, doc.

597
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,479
Um...

598
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:07,439
my friend's on his

599
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:08,239
last bag of IV.

600
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,600
Please keep an eye on him.

601
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,279
I gotta go.

602
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,400
Don't hold back when you remove the needle.

603
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:16,320
He can take the pain.

604
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,600
Call Rao Jing.

605
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,719
Calling Rao Jing.

606
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:38,800
Ms Rao.

607
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:39,320
Speak.

608
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,360
There's a name card

609
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:43,279
of a client on my desk.

610
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,519
Can I trouble you to take a picture

611
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,519
of it and send it to me?

612
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,719
You in the office right?

613
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:48,800
I got a dog

614
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,360
and it's having a bit of

615
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,439
a diarrhea.

616
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,360
I gotta head back

617
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,759
pick up the messes

618
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,800
and wipe its ass.

619
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,719
Gotta go.

620
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,719
Hey!

621
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:57,840
What're you on about?

622
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:58,560
Hey.

623
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:00,679
Are we not heading back to the office?

624
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,560
Of course not.

625
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,320
I'm not letting slip

626
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:05,439
a great opportunity like this.

627
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,959
This whole "blind date loan" thing has turned into a giant mess.

628
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
If she handles it well,

629
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
she has something to show for it

630
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,120
before the boss.

631
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:14,640
Quite a plan

632
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:15,959
she's got.

633
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,880
You were in the drama

634
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,959
club back in school, right?

635
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:49,040
Follow my lead.

636
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,320
That was fast.

637
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,519
Right back at you.

638
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:26,560
Looking for a date?

639
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,400
Have you filled in the forms?

640
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,519
We've got 90 percent

641
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,400
of the city's singletons

642
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,080
signed up here.

643
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,160
There's definitely someone for you.

644
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,519
Sir, you must be

645
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,400
eager to get a date.

646
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,479
We'll offer you a 20 percent discount.

647
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,600
Miss Tu?

648
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,239
I didn't recognize you for a second.

649
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
I've got a really

650
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,519
good match for you.

651
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,439
Same age as you.

652
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,160
Studied abroad.

653
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,679
Works in a bank.

654
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Name's Ji...

655
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,479
Have you issued

656
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,719
the invoice I told you to?

657
00:27:58,959 --> 00:27:59,400
No?

658
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,999
Let's do it now. Come on.

659
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,239
Sir, what's your type?

660
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,439
We have it all.

661
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,199
It's quite a selection.

662
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,040
Let me know your preferences.

663
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,040
I'll set you up.

664
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:07,759
Here, have a look.

665
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,479
Take a good look.

666
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:08,999
Come on.

667
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,560
Hurry.

668
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:11,279
Miss Tu,

669
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,560
was it invoice you were saying?

670
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:13,439
How come

671
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,800
I don't have any recollection of it?

672
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:16,880
Sorry,

673
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:17,999
I must've remembered it wrong.

674
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,439
It's ok.

675
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,600
I'm telling you,

676
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,479
if a different agency promises you someone handsome

677
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,560
they're probably lying.

678
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,519
But if I tell you

679
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,519
I've got a handsome guy,

680
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,080
he's

681
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,600
as handsome as they come.

682
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,999
Here, Miss Tu,

683
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:29,400
have a look.

684
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,560
You can't put them up here.

685
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,239
What was that?

686
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,479
Why don't you

687
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,999
go have some rest?

688
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,360
I'll show

689
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,519
myself around.

690
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,400
This is no trouble.

691
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,199
I'm going

692
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,800
to find you his file.

693
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I promise you'll like it.

694
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,120
Come.

695
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,679
Follow me.

696
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,040
Miss Tu,

697
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,160
have some coffee and

698
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,080
take a break.

699
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,919
I'll go get the file.

700
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,439
Thanks.

701
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,880
Thank god we haven't got the marriage certificate.

702
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,999
Otherwise

703
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,959
they'd stick that on the wall.

704
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:19,840
Scared the shit out of me.

705
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,999
Don't you worry. We've got

706
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,160
the best of best here.

707
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,239
Ma'am.

708
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,279
Did you come

709
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,199
with Miss Tu?

710
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:28,040
Yes.

711
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,439
I've got this.

712
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:29,959
You can go.

713
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:30,239
Ok.

714
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
Here, this way.

715
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,800
So...

716
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:34,759
I had a quick look earlier.

717
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,479
They used to study at the same middle school.

718
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,999
It's like it's meant to be.

719
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,999
As far as I'm concerned,

720
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,840
these two

721
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:42,560
can get married right now.

722
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:43,640
Even a one-day delay

723
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,120
would be defying fate.

724
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:46,999
Have a seat.

725
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,239
Fate?

726
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:49,479
What fate?

727
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,560
Miss Tu,

728
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,400
this is the file on Mr. Ji,

729
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,160
the one I was telling you about.

730
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,719
Come on, check out the man

731
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:57,999
fate has in store for you.

732
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,759
No, no, no.

733
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,199
There's no need.

734
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:00,800
There's no need.

735
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,880
Three.

736
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:04,439
Two.

737
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:06,840
One.

738
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:18,919
So? What do you think?

739
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,919
He looks...

740
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,840
like a nice guy...

741
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,080
Let's find out more.

742
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:30,800
I don't think

743
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,600
I'm good enough for him.

744
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,840
No such thing.

745
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:34,600
It's ok.

746
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,279
Let's keep looking.

747
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,840
Why don't you show me instead?

748
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,279
Come in.

749
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,719
Sir.

750
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:46,360
Yuheng.

751
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,479
Come.

752
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:47,880
Come on over.

753
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,439
How's your injury?

754
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,040
Is it bad?

755
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:50,959
It's not a big deal.

756
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,199
Come. Sit.

757
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,120
A knife attack

758
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,279
has never happened before

759
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,120
at BDD.

760
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,840
My apologies.

761
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,679
I didn't expect things

762
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:01,400
to turn out like this.

763
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:03,919
I've already sent Zhao

764
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,080
to look it up.

765
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:05,800
We should

766
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,640
have an answer soon.

767
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,120
It's a legacy

768
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,040
of your predecessor.

769
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,679
Why, though, are you

770
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,999
still using that Zhao?

771
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,040
Granted, Jiang is the one to blame here.

772
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,519
But Zhao did all the dirty work.

773
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,279
You still trust him

774
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,320
to undo the damage?

775
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,080
Actually, sir, that's

776
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,519
why I'm here.

777
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,320
I went through all the consumer loan

778
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,840
contracts the past few days.

779
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,360
Zhao wasn't

780
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,040
directly involved in much of it.

781
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,239
I've also

782
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:32,040
been watching him

783
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,959
at work.

784
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,120
He might

785
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,160
look like a slacker.

786
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,880
But he treats

787
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,719
his job seriously.

788
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,759
Detail-oriented too.

789
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,800
On top of that,

790
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:43,840
he's got the highest number

791
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,239
of government clients

792
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,360
in the entire department.

793
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,360
All this shows

794
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,679
he's good at his job

795
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,800
I don't question his ability.

796
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,080
But the issue is

797
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,120
is he on your side?

798
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,320
I don't really mind

799
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,999
if he's not on my side.

800
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,679
What I want

801
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:03,800
is for him to contribute

802
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,679
to the department.

803
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:05,999
He's the

804
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:07,360
operator on these loans.

805
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,080
He wants this resolved

806
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,239
ASAP

807
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,919
more than anyone.

808
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:13,360
So, he'll get to

809
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,120
the bottom of this for his

810
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,080
own job if not anything else.

811
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,880
"Blind date loan?"

812
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
That's a thing?

813
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:22,320
So Gao wasn't lying to me.

814
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,320
Neither of us

815
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
has the money to get married.

816
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:27,759
He was able to

817
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,080
get a load for the bride price.

818
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
I can't fall behind, can I.

819
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,040
Exactly.

820
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,560
This product of ours

821
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,640
is nondiscriminatory.

822
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,959
It doesn't require you to

823
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,160
provide qualifications either.

824
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,040
Is this some

825
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,239
kind of usury?

826
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,519
It's not. You have my word.

827
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:44,479
Proper loan from the bank.

828
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,479
Perks of using our flatform.

829
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,400
We've got

830
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:50,999
connections.

831
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,719
Great.

832
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:55,400
But

833
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,400
what if

834
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,199
I can't pay it back?

835
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,160
For us folks,

836
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,759
100 grand for bride price

837
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:01,360
tops.

838
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,679
That amount is nothing

839
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:03,880
for the banks.

840
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:04,800
If I

841
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:05,959
apply for the loan

842
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,080
through you,

843
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,199
can the dating service

844
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:10,840
fees be exempted?

845
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Non members

846
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,439
have to pay

847
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,600
5 percent for the service fees.

848
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,320
But our members

849
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,279
only have to pay 3 percent.

850
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:18,919
A mere 3 percent

851
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,959
and your marriage affairs are all sorted.

852
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,880
You're right.

853
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,600
With the money problem sorted,

854
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,439
I'll be one

855
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:27,679
big step

856
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,279
closer to marriage.

857
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,919
Oh, right, which bank

858
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:32,759
do you work with?

859
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:35,640
Look,

860
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:37,439
money don't come easily

861
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,360
to folks like us.

862
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,479
I just want to see the contract.

863
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,759
For peace of mind, you know.

864
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,880
Dairui.

865
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,640
You must've heard of it.

866
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:47,679
What we provide

867
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,080
is an agency contract.

868
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,919
So...

869
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:53,880
you are in

870
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,439
very good connections

871
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,479
with Dairui.

872
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:59,439
Will there be any problem if my sister

873
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,239
applies for a loan here?

874
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,999
And who do we blame

875
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,320
if there is?

876
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

877
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,120
Here.

878
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,080
Have a read.

879
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,719
Ok.

880
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,959
I don't know if I can read this.

881
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:10,840
Look at

882
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,800
all this information.

883
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,719
Let me tell you.

884
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,040
When our boss started

885
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,080
this company, it was a client manager

886
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,560
surnamed Jiang from Dairui

887
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,919
who processed

888
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:20,439
his loan.

889
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,120
They got along

890
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,239
like brothers.

891
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,759
Within only a couple of years,

892
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,719
this guy became

893
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,360
the department manager in charge of loans.

894
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,719
Seeing that you're so tight with the bank,

895
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,959
you must be offering a handsome sum

896
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,199
to that manager.

897
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,080
You don't

898
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,520
get anything for free these days.

899
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,319
That's between the bosses.

900
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,839
I'm not in a position to comment.

901
00:34:38,799 --> 00:34:39,759
But rest assured,

902
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,120
as long as this manager Jiang is still in place,

903
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,440
your loan

904
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,040
will

905
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,839
come through.

906
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:47,359
Great.

907
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:48,839
Xiaoning,

908
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,199
I'm finally getting

909
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:53,040
a handle on this.

910
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:56,920
Thank you.

911
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,719
You've been explaining things

912
00:34:58,799 --> 00:34:59,879
all this time

913
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:00,799
and I still haven't

914
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
signed

915
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,600
the dating contract.

916
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,399
Why don't you

917
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
bring it over?

918
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,120
I'll sign both today.

919
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,000
No problem.

920
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,759
Wait here.

921
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:08,399
I'll go get it now.

922
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,359
Ok.

923
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,399
You seem to be in a good mood.

924
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,239
Although I'm not responsible for

925
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,440
this "blind date loan" fiasco,

926
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,679
as a Dairui employee,

927
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:28,440
I have the obligation to

928
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,600
help the bank wherever I can.

929
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:30,879
Seems you

930
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,279
have got your hands on

931
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:33,719
some scraps of evidence.

932
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,600
But is that enough

933
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,399
to wash the stains off you?

934
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:41,759
I won't lie.

935
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:42,600
I did obtain

936
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,239
some essential evidence.

937
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:45,199
You, on the other hand,

938
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,480
put on such a show,

939
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,399
trying to bury me under it.

940
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:48,600
I guess your little

941
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,839
plan didn't work.

942
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,319
Don't flatter

943
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,960
yourself.

944
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,960
You're already waist deep in the water.

945
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,560
why would I bother?

946
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,679
I'm the one who's helping the bank.

947
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,279
I don't care

948
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:00,960
if you know.

949
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:02,520
I just want the bosses to know that.

950
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,560
Rao Jing.

951
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:07,719
Rao Jing.

952
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,679
Do you really not

953
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,839
care we're colleagues?

954
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:11,920
Climbing over my dead

955
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,000
body to get what you want?

956
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,679
Well, that's

957
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,199
because I can.

958
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,600
If you get the chance,

959
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,480
you may do the same.

960
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,440
Now that we have a winner,

961
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:25,199
I'm done here.

962
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,279
Honey.

963
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:26,960
Here you are.

964
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,560
I'm off then.

965
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,719
I have a date.

966
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,359
Bye.

967
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,640
You drive.

968
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:41,399
What did she say she was doing?

969
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,960
On a date.

970
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,879
Jing has a boyfriend.

971
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,839
A much younger one at that.

972
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,839
I'll be damned.

973
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,679
A vicious hag like her

974
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,839
has a boyfriend.

975
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,239
Door Unlocked.

976
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:02,440
Door locked.

977
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,000
Ji Yuheng.

978
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:06,879
Ji Yuheng.

979
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,040
What's going on?

980
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,560
Did you fall?

981
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,040
Come in.

982
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,839
I thought you fell.

983
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,600
It's just my hand.

984
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,239
Can you help me change?

985
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,319
Sure.

986
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,679
So...

987
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,040
I went to the dating company with Jing today

988
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:39,040
and saw

989
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,279
the photos we used for dating

990
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,080
on the wall.

991
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:43,679
I took them down immediately

992
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,160
so they didn't find out.

993
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,839
Did I do good?

994
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,120
Certainly.

995
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,640
So as a reward,

996
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,480
tonight...

997
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,440
Tonight?

998
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:00,640
Actually,

999
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,440
I'm meeting Ling Weiyi at the gym.

1000
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,600
I almost forgot.

1001
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,319
I gotta go.

1002
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,239
I was gonna say I'll do the chores tonight.

1003
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,160
I was the one who did something good.

1004
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,960
Why did I run off

1005
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,399
like a guilty person?

1006
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:23,279
Don't you think

1007
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:24,920
you overreacted?

1008
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,000
So your husband

1009
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,279
said "tonight."

1010
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,399
What's the big deal?

1011
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,480
So...

1012
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,600
does he have a great body?

1013
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,719
Like I'd know.

1014
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:34,920
We're newly

1015
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,040
weds in name only.

1016
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,759
In truth,

1017
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:38,000
we're just roommates.

1018
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,040
But that doesn't mean

1019
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,719
he sees you as his roommate.

1020
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,160
A knife attack it was.

1021
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,799
He blocked a knife for you.

1022
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,480
Ziwei took a knife for the Emperor

1023
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,199
because he's her Father.

1024
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:51,960
Are you his Mother?

1025
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:52,920
Bite me.

1026
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:55,879
Think about it.

1027
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,319
Let's say this Ji Yuheng

1028
00:38:57,319 --> 00:38:57,920
is

1029
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,520
an upstanding guy.

1030
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,520
But not every upstanding guy

1031
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,440
will take a knife for you.

1032
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,040
Averting danger is human nature.

1033
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,799
As far as I'm concerned,

1034
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,279
this future husband of yours

1035
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,679
definitely has feelings for you.

1036
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,239
Enough.

1037
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,440
Rather than being such

1038
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,719
an expert on my relationship.

1039
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,399
Shouldn't you

1040
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,640
reflect on your own?

1041
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,960
What about me?

1042
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,759
I'm a single woman with all the freedom in the world.

1043
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,480
Unlike someone,

1044
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,359
who's in a sea of trouble,

1045
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,759
what with the future husband

1046
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:26,879
and the ex-boyfriend.

1047
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,719
What now?

1048
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,960
Lu Sijing talked to you?

1049
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,719
He called me

1050
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,560
and asked

1051
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,759
what's the deal with you and Ji.

1052
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,879
What did you say?

1053
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,399
Said you were co-inhabitants of Earth.

1054
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,160
Good answer.

1055
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:44,920
It's a small city.

1056
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,040
The fewer people know about it,

1057
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
the safer we are.

1058
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:53,199
Do you still

1059
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:54,719
think about that person?

1060
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,319
Of course not.

1061
00:39:59,239 --> 00:39:59,960
Listen.

1062
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,239
Mr. Ji

1063
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,520
saved you

1064
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,239
by blocking that knife.

1065
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:04,799
Why don't you head back

1066
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:05,679
and take care of him?

1067
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,359
This is not the time

1068
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,600
to act coy.

1069
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:09,839
Forget about the shirt.

1070
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,920
Just jump on him.

1071
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:12,199
Like fire meets wood.

1072
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,520
Have yourselves a night of tender love.

1073
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,359
A night you'll never forget.

1074
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:14,719
Cut it.

1075
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,319
You've been reading too much romance fiction.

1076
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:19,160
That's where this nonsense is coming from.

1077
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,839
I'm being serious.

1078
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,759
A knife

1079
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,199
He blocked a knife for you.

1080
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,160
This future husband of yours

1081
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,440
definitely has feelings for you.

1082
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:42,879
Xiaoning.

1083
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,920
Your hand's hurt.

1084
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,600
You should've stayed at home.

1085
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,040
I'm ok.

1086
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,679
You were out for a long time.

1087
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,440
And it's getting late.

1088
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,640
I was worried.

1089
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,640
I went to get some fruit.

1090
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,640
Let's go home.

1091
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:01,960
Take a walk home?

1092
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,399
Sure.

1093
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:09,679
Here.

1094
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:10,279
Give it to me.

1095
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,399
But your hand's injured.

1096
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:13,199
It's ok.

1097
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,359
I can use the other hand.

1098
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,279
So much

1099
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,359
has happened today.

1100
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,160
What else

1101
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,480
besides the

1102
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,080
knife accident?

1103
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,440
What's the matter?

1104
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:32,160
Would you still run over

1105
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,399
to save them

1106
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,120
if it hadn't been me

1107
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,480
this morning?

1108
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:40,920
I would.

1109
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,839
But if it had been someone else,

1110
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,440
I'd save them cos I'm their boss.

1111
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:47,920
But it was you.

1112
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,080
I saved you not only because I'm your boss

1113
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:54,199
but because I'm your soon-to-be husband.

1114
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,319
Come on.

1115
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,279
It feels nice

1116
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:13,040
to have someone in this world

1117
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,480
who's willing to

1118
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,359
sacrifice themselves

1119
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:18,080
for you.

1120
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:04,960
The results are out.

1121
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:06,520
Excuse me.

1122
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,759
Excuse me.

1123
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,799
I'm in the top 50.

1124
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:16,719
Impressive.

1125
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,480
Give me your phone.

1126
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,000
Left mine in the classroom.

1127
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,480
Let me take a picture

1128
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,799
and send it to my mom.

1129
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,480
That'll raise my

1130
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:25,319
monthly allowance

1131
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,319
for sure.

1132
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,799
But this is just the History score.

1133
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,839
Not the total score.

1134
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:30,759
It'll be fine.

1135
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,040
My mom is

1136
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:32,960
easy to fool.

1137
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,960
Why is Mr. Straight A

1138
00:43:58,199 --> 00:43:59,719
only taking a picture of the History score?

1139
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,920
Isn't that obvious?

1140
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,000
his only weakness

1141
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,239
is History.

1142
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,239
It's a reminder that

1143
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,399
he needs to work on that.
