[You Are My Secret]
[EP20]

3
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,479
Really?

4
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,479
Did the doctor

5
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,000
actually say that?

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,800
Yes, he did.

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,080
He said that this time the medication

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,920
has shown significant improvement.

9
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,840
You can be discharged and go home.

10
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,720
In a few days,

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,239
we'll help you with the procedures.

12
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,119
Then we can go home.

13
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,640
It's great to be able to go home.

14
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,000
That's fantastic!

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,679
Could

16
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,319
you please

17
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,160
help me clear out

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,000
the old house?

19
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,319
What's wrong, mom?

20
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,759
Do you hate me or something?

21
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,119
Don't you want to live with me?

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,200
What are you saying, my dear?

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,759
I like you more than anything.

24
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,720
As long as you don't hate me,

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,120
I'll stay with you

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520
in the old house.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
That's not a good idea!

28
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,280
You two

29
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,960
are newlyweds.

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,160
How can I let you stay with me?

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,520
Why not?

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,319
You see, you don't want

33
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,240
to live with us,

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,919
which means

35
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,520
you must hate one of us.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,879
If it's not me,

37
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,120
it must be him.

38
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,680
Anyway,

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,479
we won't push you.

40
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,079
But we can't

41
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,160
let you live on your own.

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
So I'll have to stay with you.

43
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:51,840
No, Xiaoning,

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,720
I...

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
I didn't mean it that way.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,199
What I meant was...

47
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,359
That's not what you meant?

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,199
Then let's just go home.

49
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,120
It's settled then.

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,440
You little rascal,

51
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,240
play all these little tricks on me.

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm just teasing you.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,759
Cheer up a little.

54
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,720
Come home, alright?

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,520
[It's a deal.]

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,720
Hey.

57
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,440
Hey, you guys are here.

58
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,479
Dad, mom.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,440
Yuheng.

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,680
How're you doing?

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,879
Pretty good.

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,919
Is it?

63
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,400
I'll take that.

64
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,960
I cooked mushroom soup for you.

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,759
[I was trying to make some chicken soup.]

66
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,359
[I bought the chicken,]

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,079
but she wouldn't let me.

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,759
She's going through "immunocetechemistry,"

69
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,079
so she can't take in estrogen.

70
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,319
Chicken soup is no good to her.

71
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,079
That's really absurd.

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,720
Isn't it?

73
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,520
Taking chicken soup

74
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,199
to boost estrogen is just pseudoscience.

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,199
Besides,

76
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,639
that's called immunocytochemistry,

77
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,359
not immunocetechemistry.

78
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,039
Do you even understand that term?

79
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,799
[You all come by every so often]

80
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,079
[to bring me food.]

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,240
It's been a blessing

82
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,160
for my stomach.

83
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,039
[I'm so content.]

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,919
Look at how round it's gotten.

85
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,879
For your information,

86
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,879
today there's more than just food.

87
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:03,400
I brought you something special.

88
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,599
This is something I just bought.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,639
"The Bullet! BANG!"

90
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:08,359
Check it out.

91
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:09,960
It's "BANG! The Bullet!"

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,919
Fine, "The Bullet! BANG! "

93
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,840
Today it's called

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,720
"The Bullet! BANG! "

95
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,720
no matter what!

96
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,680
Honestly, I'm quite jealous of the

97
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,240
relationship you have with your parents.

98
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,200
My relationship with my mom

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,439
was actually

100
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,840
worse before

101
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,439
the two of us started dating.

102
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:41,880
Before, I spent

103
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,999
three years studying overseas.

104
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,400
Until last year,

105
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,919
when she got sick,

106
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,119
I returned to Xing city.

107
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,919
Actually, my mom always felt

108
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,039
that she didn't really understand me.

109
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,520
I feel the same way.

110
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,080
I also don't know

111
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:54,720
how to get along with her.

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
It's not too late, though.

113
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,439
Once mom is discharged,

114
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,799
make sure to spend more time with her.

115
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:06,960
Her health

116
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,080
is improving daily.

117
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,919
This is a chance that fate has given you.

118
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,119
You should seize this opportunity.

119
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,359
Just don't leave yourself with regrets.

120
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,119
Understood.

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,280
Boss,

122
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,320
you're impressive.

123
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,880
Zhouyang Hotel is quite a tough challenge.

124
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,679
Before Mr. Jiang left,

125
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,840
he was always concerned about this.

126
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,160
I didn't expect that you secured the deal

127
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
after making contact with them

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,919
for less than a month.

129
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,239
There's an element of luck,

130
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,080
but it's mainly thanks to

131
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,119
everyone's hard work.

132
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,239
Yuheng, you're being modest.

133
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:37,320
Everyone knows

134
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,679
how difficult it is to deal with its boss.

135
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,359
You could nail him in an instant.

136
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,960
It's a testament to your hard work.

137
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,280
Yuhui, we work in a bank, so

138
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,599
we should try to avoid discussing clients.

139
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:46,559
Especially, we shouldn't

140
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,559
bad-mouth them.

141
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,679
Aren't we on the same team?

142
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,200
Just chatting, just chatting.

143
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,760
Yuheng is right.

144
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,679
I'll be more careful.

145
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:00,439
Hey, boss,

146
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,160
since we've just landed such a major deal,

147
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,720
shouldn't we...

148
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,280
How about a dinner?

149
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,239
How about tonight!

150
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,359
Tomorrow is the weekend,

151
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:09,080
and I need to take my mom back home

152
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,119
to pay respects at my dad's grave.

153
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,119
I'll need to head back tonight

154
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:11,960
to get ready.

155
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,160
How about this:

156
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,160
once the deal is finalized,

157
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,720
I'll take care of the celebration dinner.

158
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,559
Sounds good!

159
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,200
It's a deal then.

160
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,239
I'll get back to work now.

161
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:19,799
Alright.

162
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:20,679
Let's get to work!

163
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:35,039
Yuheng.

164
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,160
Yuhui, I've told you before

165
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,039
that in our company...

166
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:39,999
Mr. Ji.

167
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,479
Sorry I slipped.

168
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:43,439
I'll be careful next time.

169
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:46,559
Were you looking for me?

170
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:48,559
Last time,

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,119
we went to the hospital to visit your mom.

172
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,280
I asked the staff,

173
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,720
and they said that each caregiver

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
has to take care of two patients.

175
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,320
I'm worried that there might

176
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,599
not be enough care for your mom.

177
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:57,720
How about this:

178
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,799
I have a friend

179
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,559
who runs a nursing home.

180
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,280
Let's hire a caregiver for her.

181
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:03,880
I can get a discount.

182
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,320
The price would be much lower.

183
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:07,520
I appreciate it,

184
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,679
but she's very happy with the current one.

185
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,999
She doesn't need it.

186
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,599
Thanks anyway.

187
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,280
Then

188
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:13,999
how about this:

189
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,840
Starting today,

190
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,679
I'll visit her after work

191
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,679
to keep her company.

192
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,439
I actually wanted to go.

193
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:23,559
But I was

194
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,919
worried you might think

195
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,400
I was trying to get close to her

196
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,760
because of work.

197
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,200
I just feel that

198
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,160
she is getting older

199
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,119
and quite lonely.

200
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,439
You're busy with work,

201
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,320
so I can go in your place.

202
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,119
Thank you so much.

203
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,200
But it's really not necessary.

204
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,239
Why not?

205
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,239
I feel I get along

206
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,280
well with her.

207
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,599
And besides,

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,679
as a mother,

209
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,039
if she sees the right girl

210
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,720
around her son,

211
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,479
she should feel more at ease, right?

212
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,479
I've told you already.

213
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,400
It really isn't necessary.

214
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:57,960
And it's working hours right now.

215
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,439
You should get back to work.

216
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,559
You know very well

217
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,679
how I feel about you.

218
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,359
During work hours,

219
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,599
I really shouldn't be saying this.

220
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,799
But to avoid any complications,

221
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,439
I think I should

222
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,320
make things clear.

223
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,280
I have someone I like.

224
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,280
[There's no chance for us.]

225
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:25,999
Who is it?

226
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:27,999
Mr. Ji.

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,119
I brought the files you requested.

228
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,319
You heard everything?

229
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,280
You were quite firm.

230
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,199
Good job.

231
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,919
Give it back!

232
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,360
Limin,

233
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:16,559
Yuheng and I

234
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:18,199
haven't come to see you

235
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:19,600
for years.

236
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,600
[I used to come alone,]

237
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,079
[and I would always ramble on]

238
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,120
[about him.]

239
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,760
Every time I'd say,

240
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,240
next time I'd bring him along.

241
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,799
I've been fooling you all these years.

242
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,799
Please don't hold it against me.

243
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:46,520
[Look,]

244
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,199
I've kept my promise,

245
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
and I brought him to see you.

246
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,439
Xiaoning,

247
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,480
come here.

248
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,319
Let dad take a good look at you.

249
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,520
Limin,

250
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,000
this is our daughter-in-law,

251
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,559
Xiaoning.

252
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,760
Xiaoning is

253
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,079
not only beautiful but also kind,

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,959
a truly wonderful girl.

255
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,280
With her by Yuheng's side,

256
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,280
we can all feel at ease.

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,679
Go on and talk to dad.

258
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm good.

259
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,319
It's been a while, hasn't it?

260
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,280
Go ahead.

261
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,160
I'm doing well.

262
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,480
Mom is doing well too.

263
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,360
We'll visit you more often from now on,

264
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,000
dad.

265
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,120
Take it easy.

266
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,719
It's been a long time since I came back.

267
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,679
Let's clean up a bit.

268
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,039
We'll manage for tonight.

269
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,559
Family photo, mom?

270
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,760
This was taken

271
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,799
on Yuheng's eighth birthday.

272
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,520
We took it in the yard.

273
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,000
When you were little, you didn't

274
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,160
have the qualities of an old cadre at all.

275
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,160
Mom,

276
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,919
the filling for your dumplings

277
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,959
smells amazing.

278
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,799
I can smell it

279
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,480
from so far away.

280
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,240
No wonder Yuheng loves it.

281
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:17,039
I gave you the recipe.

282
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,600
You filmed the whole process too.

283
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,079
You're a smart girl;

284
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,880
you'll master it after a couple of tries.

285
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,919
He'll definitely prefer the ones you make.

286
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,679
I don't have that kind of confidence.

287
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,480
Didn't you just mention?

288
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,559
When he was little,

289
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,719
even if

290
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,880
there were just two drops

291
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
less of sesame oil,

292
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,839
he could taste the difference.

293
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:38,439
Mine definitely can't compete with yours.

294
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,039
Back then,

295
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:42,799
whenever I made dumplings,

296
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,039
he would invite

297
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,400
his friends

298
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,760
over to eat.

299
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,600
[All boys.]

300
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,240
[That was during their growth spurts.]

301
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,439
[Once my dumplings were done,]

302
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,439
they'd be gone in the blink of an eye.

303
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,000
Then

304
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,360
they would say he

305
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,880
[was tall,]

306
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,719
[and it was all thanks to my dumplings.]

307
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
When he was in middle school,

308
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,799
he was one of

309
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,120
the tallest in class.

310
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,520
He loved playing basketball back then.

311
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,120
Every day after school,

312
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,160
he would play for an hour or two.

313
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,079
[With all that exercise,]

314
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,600
[it was hard for him to gain weight.]

315
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,679
For a while, he looked

316
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,120
like he was malnourished.

317
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,760
He would look in the mirror and say,

318
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,319
''Why do I look like a bean sprout?''

319
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,000
Mom, hearing you talk about him as a kid,

320
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,079
makes me feel he was quite fun and cute.

321
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,719
He seems like a totally different guy now.

322
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,039
After his dad passed away,

323
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,719
I became

324
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,240
much more distant from him.

325
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,559
[Now that I think about it,]

326
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,000
[the only memories]

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,319
[I can recall are]

328
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,199
just a few moments from his childhood.

329
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,199
[These days,]

330
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,559
you understand him much better than me.

331
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,120
Mom, look,

332
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,559
this one turned out pretty good, right?

333
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,000
This one is good.

334
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:53,520
Come on,

335
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,319
let's light the candles.

336
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,079
Come on.

337
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,839
Blow out the candles.

338
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,959
After that,

339
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,240
we'll eat the cake!

340
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,240
Sounds good!

341
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,360
But you haven't made a wish yet.

342
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,559
You shouldn't blow out the candles.

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,199
You two!

344
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,679
Then I'll make a wish now.

345
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:08,959
OK.

346
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,039
- We forgot to make a wish.
- I hope

347
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,480
I will eat

348
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,760
dumplings made by mom every day.

349
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,760
Let her make dumplings every day.

350
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,079
That would wear mom out!

351
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Let's change it, OK?

352
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,760
Then I wish for dad and mom

353
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,000
to live long lives.

354
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,719
Our family

355
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,400
will always be together.

356
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,040
That's a wonderful wish!

357
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,840
Then this wish must

358
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,199
come true,

359
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,120
right?

360
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,320
Come on,

361
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,400
let's take a picture.

362
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,199
Come on.

363
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Come on, Yuheng,

364
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,320
Smile!

365
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,360
Come on.

366
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,919
Happy birthday!

367
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,479
Mom,

368
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:20,800
why aren't you asleep yet?

369
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:23,759
Is the bed uncomfortable?

370
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:25,759
Not at all.

371
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,320
I slept the whole time

372
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,999
on the way.

373
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,400
Now I just can't fall asleep.

374
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,560
Did I wake you up?

375
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:35,360
No,

376
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,360
I just happened to take a few

377
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,160
calls from work.

378
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,840
What's this?

379
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,600
This is something your dad left.

380
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,840
I couldn't sleep,

381
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,479
so I took it out.

382
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,160
This photo

383
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:14,080
and the one next to it

384
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,519
were taken on the same day.

385
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Your dad

386
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,880
always kept it in his wallet,

387
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,600
carrying it with him.

388
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,759
This was before we talked about

389
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,679
going to Yunnan.

390
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,239
I made a wish at that time.

391
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,519
I said,

392
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,840
I wanted to eat

393
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,880
dumplings made by you every day.

394
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,320
Dad said no,

395
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,239
that would wear you out.

396
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:50,999
He told me to change a wish.

397
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,199
You actually remember all that?

398
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,840
Back then, our family

399
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,759
was so happy together.

400
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,719
Actually,

401
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:23,320
when we visited dad's grave today,

402
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,120
I noticed there was something on his mind.

403
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,120
Yuheng is like that;

404
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,160
sometimes,

405
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,160
he's like a closed-off person

406
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,759
not willing to share his feelings.

407
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,120
You need to draw him out.

408
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,120
If you're willing, mom,

409
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,160
this is a good opportunity

410
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,080
to talk to him.

411
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,080
You can also ask him

412
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,360
what he's really thinking.

413
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,080
Yuheng,

414
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,279
there's something

415
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,400
I've always wanted to ask you.

416
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,560
When your dad passed away,

417
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,360
deep down,

418
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:34,400
did you blame us?

419
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,560
Your dad committed suicide.

420
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,719
And I was devastated.

421
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,880
[I was in despair every day.]

422
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,600
It's all in the past, mom.

423
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,719
Time has passed,

424
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:04,679
but that doesn't mean the pain has gone.

425
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:07,840
At that time,

426
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,279
I was mad

427
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,120
at your dad

428
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,880
for not sharing his struggles with us.

429
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,360
I also resented him

430
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,080
for leaving us behind,

431
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,040
and ending it all

432
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,560
on his own.

433
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,679
[Every day,]

434
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,719
[it was either complaints]

435
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
[or sadness.]

436
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,759
That's why I didn't want you to mention him,

437
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,919
nor did I want you to visit his grave.

438
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,479
But I overlooked

439
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,800
that you were still a child.

440
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:54,320
A child

441
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,360
who just lost his dad.

442
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,840
At that time,

443
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,880
you had to study,

444
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,759
take care of me,

445
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,719
and deal with everyone's

446
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,679
comments about your dad.

447
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,479
You carried so much pain

448
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,360
all by yourself.

449
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:29,360
Today,

450
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,800
when I was at the grave, I saw you

451
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,600
standing in front of me,

452
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,279
not knowing

453
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,600
how to talk

454
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,880
to your dad.

455
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,519
It's all because of me back then.

456
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,679
All these years,

457
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,160
while you were studying overseas,

458
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,360
I only know dumplings; but besides that

459
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,919
I don't even know

460
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,479
what else you enjoy eating.

461
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,040
[I don't even know your hobbies.]

462
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,519
I also don't know

463
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:16,120
what difficulties you've experienced,

464
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,880
[or how you've managed to get through them.]

465
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,959
Everyone says

466
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,640
you're very independent.

467
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,919
But I know that's

468
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,959
because you have no one to depend on.

469
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:46,919
Yuheng,

470
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,439
all these years,

471
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,479
mom owes you

472
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,719
an apology.

473
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,160
I'm really sorry.

474
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,479
These years,

475
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,679
you must have had a tough time.

476
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,640
Mom,

477
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,160
you don't need to apologize.

478
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,719
Because of dad's suicide,

479
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,199
I did blame you both.

480
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,080
I blamed him for leaving so suddenly.

481
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,320
I blamed you

482
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,999
for not caring enough about me.

483
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,160
Honestly, I really didn't understand

484
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,519
why you were so devastated

485
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:15,959
when dad was gone.

486
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,239
It wasn't until I met Xiaoning

487
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,320
that I realized that true love

488
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,840
might really be inseparable.

489
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
If it weren't for me,

490
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,080
you might have gone

491
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,959
after dad, right?

492
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,560
Mom,

493
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:54,919
[over the years,]

494
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,080
you and I

495
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,439
have slowly grown distant.

496
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,719
That's my fault.

497
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:04,279
[I didn't give you an opportunity.]

498
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,759
I'm sorry, mom.

499
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,400
All these years,

500
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,239
you've been so lonely on your own.

501
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,199
I...

502
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,040
I've been trying

503
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,479
to be your support.

504
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,719
Let's work together

505
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
to make up for the lost time.

506
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,120
We definitely will, mom.

507
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,959
We definitely will.

508
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,800
We definitely will.

509
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,199
Xiaoning, let me tell you,

510
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,759
their sunflower seeds

511
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:09,600
are especially good.

512
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,679
Good morning.

513
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,959
How was your sleep?

514
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah.

515
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,719
Why are you up so early?

516
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,400
Xiaoning said

517
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,479
she didn't

518
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,519
dream at all last night.

519
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,320
She slept deeply,

520
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:27,679
so she woke up early.

521
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,840
There's breakfast on the table.

522
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,679
Help yourself.

523
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,320
Did you already eat?

524
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:38,400
We all did.

525
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,560
Mom,

526
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,719
did you sleep well last night?

527
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:44,679
I slept quite well.

528
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,360
Today, since we're free,

529
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,640
how about we accompany you

530
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,560
to walk around the town?

531
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,439
You don't need to be with me.

532
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,360
Just take Xiaoning

533
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,160
out for a walk.

534
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,800
As for me,

535
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,360
I want to

536
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,600
visit the grave again later.

537
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,400
It's rare for me to come back.

538
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:08,360
I want to

539
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,560
have a little chat

540
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,360
with your dad.

541
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,479
Let him show you around the town.

542
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:23,759
OK.

543
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,840
I see you're in a good mood today.

544
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,959
What's up?

545
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,120
Did you win the lottery?

546
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,919
I was chatting with mom last night.

547
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:51,959
Didn't you hear us?

548
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,519
I didn't hear anything.

549
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,479
I slept really deeply last night.

550
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,439
I didn't hear a thing.

551
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,360
Really?

552
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,080
Then when I

553
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,999
got back to my room.

554
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:00,880
Why did I suddenly see a

555
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,239
shadow rushing into the bed?

556
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,120
Wasn't that you?

557
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,279
Were we haunted or something?

558
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,840
Don't scare me, OK?

559
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,279
I'm not the kind of girl

560
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
who eavesdrops on others.

561
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,080
Last night, mom said

562
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,679
she's feeling much better.

563
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,040
This time when we go back,

564
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,560
we should arrange for her discharge.

565
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,519
We can take her home.

566
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,360
Really?

567
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:19,800
No wonder

568
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,199
today she wanted to go alone

569
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:23,239
to chat with dad and share some whispers.

570
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,080
That's good.

571
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,999
Are you wondering

572
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,919
what happened

573
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:32,800
to my dad back then?

574
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,600
I do want to ask,

575
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,840
but

576
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,199
it's up to you whether you want to share.

577
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,400
I understand

578
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,479
this is a scar in your heart.

579
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,199
I'll listen when you're ready to talk.

580
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,439
It's cool.

581
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
If it's something you want to know,

582
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,679
I'll let you know for sure.

583
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,080
Let's go.

584
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,880
Dad also worked

585
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,400
at a bank back then.

586
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,560
But later he got involved in

587
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:00,999
a case of illegal loan.

588
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,759
At that time, the entire

589
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,679
mortgage process

590
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,800
was very irregular.

591
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
His old neighbor

592
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,439
ran a small factory.

593
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,400
Later, to raise money,

594
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,239
he used a shady contract

595
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,479
to borrow a large sum

596
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,239
from my dad's bank.

597
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,320
Later, this factory

598
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,999
went bankrupt

599
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:19,840
due to mismanagement.

600
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,320
That guy

601
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,679
absconded with the money.

602
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:25,759
My dad really wanted

603
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,759
to recover that money.

604
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,439
But unexpectedly, the guy's parents

605
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,479
threatened to kill themselves.

606
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,959
They also claimed that

607
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,600
my dad received a huge kickback.

608
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,239
They used sleeping pills to

609
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,800
fight against my dad.

610
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,439
[They replaced the sleeping pills]

611
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,759
[with vitamins.]

612
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,199
[They were completely unharmed,]

613
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,080
[but stayed in the hospital,]

614
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,040
[pretending to be sick.]

615
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,600
[They also claimed that the]

616
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,400
[instigator of the whole thing]

617
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,199
[was my dad.]

618
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:52,479
[At that time, this whole thing]

619
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,080
[became widely known.]

620
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:56,199
[My dad couldn't even explain himself.]

621
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,400
[He became the focus of]

622
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,040
[gossip among neighbors.]

623
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,959
Yuheng,

624
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,320
something bad happened!

625
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,519
It's your dad!

626
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,800
He's covered in blood!

627
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Go home, hurry!

628
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:16,880
[I don't remember how far]

629
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,840
[I ran that day,]

630
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,519
[nor how long I ran.]

631
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,279
[I can only remember that when I]

632
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,279
[got to the hospital,]

633
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:25,719
[I heard my mom's cries.]

634
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:27,919
[My dad was]

635
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:28,600
[a proud man.]

636
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,279
[He really wanted to prove]

637
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,080
[his innocence.]

638
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,160
So one spring evening,

639
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,800
he chose to jump off a building.

640
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,400
He chose to end his life

641
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,160
to clear his name.

642
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,600
But after he passed away,

643
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,479
my mom fell apart.

644
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,600
For a long time,

645
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,239
she was on the verge of a breakdown.

646
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,080
She couldn't

647
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,239
live a normal life at all.

648
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,560
So when we met

649
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,519
on the rooftop,

650
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:05,919
it was during that time.

651
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,719
It was.

652
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:11,040
At that time, I felt like

653
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,919
all the students in school

654
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:12,840
were talking about me.

655
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,080
They were looking down on me.

656
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,800
So during that time,

657
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,279
I often went to the rooftop alone,

658
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,519
doing nothing,

659
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,919
just sitting there,

660
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,400
looking into the distance.

661
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,199
I didn't know how to

662
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,120
navigate my future.

663
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,800
Watching the sunset on the rooftop,

664
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,840
it felt like that day

665
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,160
when my dad committed suicide.

666
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,479
Actually, I really hoped

667
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,400
this was all a dream.

668
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,040
When I got home from school,

669
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,120
I wished my dad and mom

670
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,759
could greet me

671
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,120
with smiles and laughter.

672
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,840
I misunderstood back then.

673
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,640
I thought you were going to jump off.

674
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,239
To be honest,

675
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,759
I did have that thought at that time.

676
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,800
But when I thought about

677
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,679
how devastated my mom was,

678
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,919
I knew I couldn't do that.

679
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,400
So those days when I wanted to die

680
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,199
but couldn't, and they

681
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:16,679
were the darkest moments

682
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,719
of my life.

683
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,640
So you really saved me.

684
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,120
You brought light

685
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,679
into my life.

686
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,839
It turns out our fate

687
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,160
started from that moment.

688
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,160
And

689
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:39,279
thanks to you,

690
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,839
you were the only one

691
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,600
who cared about me back then.

692
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,759
So many years have passed,

693
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,480
I really should

694
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,560
thank you for it.

695
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,719
You don't need to thank me.

696
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:51,960
It was nothing.

697
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,759
Not to mention I got something in return.

698
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,879
Aren't you

699
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,520
devoted to me now?

700
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,799
Later on, I became determined

701
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,279
to work for the compliance department.

702
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:10,920
I was somewhat

703
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,759
influenced by my dad's incident.

704
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,759
I wish I could put in more effort

705
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,199
to bring about

706
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:18,799
greater regulation

707
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,920
and transparency in the industry.

708
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:21,480
Even if I could only contribute

709
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,560
a tiny bit,

710
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,839
perhaps I could help prevent

711
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,279
a family from experiencing tragedy.

712
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,000
So,

713
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,839
you had

714
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,239
already made

715
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,600
this decision back in high school.

716
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,199
I just feel it's a shame

717
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,520
that dad never got to see me

718
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,359
working in a bank.

719
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,560
He also couldn't see me transition from

720
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,080
internal control to the business side.

721
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:48,799
And he never got to see

722
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:49,440
his daughter-in-law in person.

723
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,679
This doll is so adorable!

724
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,399
Yeah.

725
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,920
Let's put her in the room

726
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,520
as a decoration.

727
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,199
It really is quite adorable.

728
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,839
I just thought of a place.

729
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,239
Let me take you there.

730
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,040
Sounds good!

731
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:05,759
Let's go.

732
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:26,480
Here, try this.

733
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,920
Just one tap.

734
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,279
Wow, you really know how to do this.

735
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,440
I thought

736
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,679
you were kidding.

737
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:34,319
I used to do it often in middle school.

738
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,399
Back then,

739
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:36,920
studying was really exhausting,

740
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,440
so this was my way to unwind.

741
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,239
But after starting college,

742
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,520
I pretty much stopped.

743
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,679
[It turns out that]

744
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,640
[clay doll]

745
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,879
[was made by him personally.]

746
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,319
Well done.

747
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,399
Actually, in our town,

748
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:03,520
the most renowned products

749
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,799
are handmade crafts.

750
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:07,160
Glass, clay sculptures, and weaving.

751
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,239
The owner of this shop

752
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,000
is my aunt.

753
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:11,160
When I was a kid,

754
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,040
my mom often brought me here.

755
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:13,759
Why did you

756
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:14,920
work at a bank?

757
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,960
Wouldn't that be

758
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,160
a waste of talent?

759
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,679
You should have developed those skills;

760
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:19,399
who knows, you might even have

761
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,359
become an artist.

762
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,520
What's going on

763
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:23,679
in that little head of yours?

764
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:24,799
So,

765
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,199
what else would you like to make?

766
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,160
Yeah,

767
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,600
I want to make one

768
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,679
for our entire family.

769
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,000
With my dad and mom,

770
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:31,960
your dad and mom,

771
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,679
and the two of us.

772
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,839
Leave no one behind.

773
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,920
That's quite a challenge.

774
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,399
And you have to make six of them at once.

775
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,160
You could do it.

776
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,000
Why wouldn't I be able to?

777
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:42,920
I can handle it.

778
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,199
Don't mind me.

779
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:45,480
You focus on yours; I'll focus on mine.

780
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:46,640
Just don't disturb me.

781
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,799
Then I'll leave you be.

782
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:49,719
Go.

783
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,120
[How's it coming along?]

784
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,239
All done!

785
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,000
Take a look.

786
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:12,560
That looks great!

787
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:13,960
Of course!

788
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,199
Thank you, aunt.

789
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:23,600
You're welcome!

790
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,679
Take it home

791
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,279
and place it somewhere safe.

792
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:26,759
Keep it

793
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,960
out of direct sunlight.

794
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,839
Got it!

795
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:31,399
This town

796
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,879
will also be your home.

797
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:33,960
Whenever you're free,

798
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,199
make sure to visit your mom

799
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,199
and explore the town.

800
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,279
Over the years,

801
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,960
the young people have all moved away,

802
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,839
leaving only us old folks behind.

803
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:43,359
By the way, aunt,

804
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,199
what happened to that family

805
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,560
across the street that made glass?

806
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,520
They struck it rich

807
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,480
last year

808
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,719
and started a company in the city,

809
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,399
[specializing in home glass installations.]

810
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:51,799
[I heard from their parents]

811
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:52,640
that the two brothers

812
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,480
plan to double their business this year.

813
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,160
They want to grow the company.

814
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,520
Grow the company, huh?

815
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,040
Aunt,

816
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,839
could you

817
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,640
give me their phone number?

818
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:03,199
If they want to expand,

819
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,239
they'll need funding, right?

820
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,480
If they need a loan,

821
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,239
they can come to me.

822
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,879
You're a pro at spotting chances!

823
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,199
That's called professional sensitivity.

824
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,920
[Of course!]

825
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,080
[We're all]

826
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,759
family here.

827
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,480
I'll send you the number later.

828
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,440
Thank you, aunt!

829
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:17,560
You're

830
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,759
welcome, sweetie.

831
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,879
Pay up.

832
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:23,679
I'm not taking your money.

833
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,359
Yuheng rarely comes back.

834
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:27,160
I won't take his money.

835
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,960
Yuheng,

836
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,759
in the future,

837
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:30,799
bring your mom back more often

838
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,440
so we old friends

839
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,399
could get a chance

840
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,679
to catch up.

841
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:35,560
Sure, no problem!

842
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:36,679
OK,

843
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,359
thank you, aunt.

844
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,080
No problem.

845
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,040
Alright.

846
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,399
We're off.

847
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,960
Goodbye, aunt!

848
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,440
See you, aunt.

849
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,120
Xiaoning, you are really talented in this.

850
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:03,640
They look fantastic.

851
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
Mom, you don't know.

852
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:05,960
Xiaoning not only

853
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,839
has skillful hands,

854
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,399
but also a creative mind.

855
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,560
When we

856
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
were making the clay sculptures,

857
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,520
she was thinking about finding clients.

858
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,080
Don't embarrass me

859
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,199
in front of mom,

860
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:17,839
That's alright.

861
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:19,560
I just

862
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:21,040
sit here,

863
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,440
watching the sunset,

864
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:24,759
enjoying the evening breeze,

865
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,600
and listening to you

866
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:28,199
chat and joke around.

867
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,199
It makes me really happy.

868
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,120
Mom,

869
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:34,719
when we are free,

870
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,759
let's go on a road trip

871
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:36,440
up north

872
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,120
to the grasslands.

873
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,120
I know you'll love it.

874
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,359
That sounds great.

875
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:45,520
Once I'm feeling better,

876
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:46,920
we should

877
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:49,040
invite your dad and mom

878
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,239
and go on a

879
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,759
family road trip.

880
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,799
Maybe I should learn to drive.

881
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,000
Is it still

882
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,359
possible at

883
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,560
my age?

884
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:04,799
Of course you can, mom.

885
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:06,239
Then

886
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,640
I'll help you learn.

887
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:10,679
Sounds good.

888
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:12,160
By the way,

889
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,799
mom,

890
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,199
Yuheng's going on a business trip tomorrow

891
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,160
for two to three days

892
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,960
to sign a contract.

893
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:18,719
When he gets back,

894
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,839
we'll take you home from the hospital.

895
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,359
You'll officially be home.

896
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:24,799
Wonderful!

897
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,120
Where's yours? Let me see yours!

898
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,799
If you ask me, working in the bank

899
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:06,839
is a waste of your talents.

900
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,399
If you developed your skills further,

901
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:09,399
you might become a

902
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:10,000
great artist.

903
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,440
How does mine look?

904
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,600
It looks fantastic!

905
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,080
This red umbrella...

906
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,279
Puling?

907
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,359
Isn't this from my dad's company?

908
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,080
I remember you have one as well.

909
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:31,839
Maybe

910
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,399
this one is the one.

911
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,239
Isn't this just a

912
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,480
promotional umbrella?

913
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,040
Why do you like it so much?

914
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,160
This is the one I used when I picked you

915
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,239
up from work for the first time.

916
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,560
Don't you remember it?

917
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,440
I remember it.

918
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,520
Of course I remember.
