2
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,080
So you have to

3
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,840
Within the shortest time

4
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Raise your performance

5
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,119
Prove that we

6
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:50,920
Worthy of this spot

7
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:53,879
Talk about it

8
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,879
Isn't it just developing customers

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,840
That's right

10
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,239
Sister Xiaoning

11
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:58,640
You have to hold on a little tighter

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,759
From developing customers to lending

13
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,200
There is also a very

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,840
A long process

15
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,160
Manager Zhao

16
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,119
What do you do

17
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,599
You put that client of yours

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,319
Give us a few small paints

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,800
Isn't this performance coming up

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,520
Your abacus

21
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,960
It's all hitting me in the face

22
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,199
You are her master

23
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,079
Why don't you give it

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Don't you know me

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,799
Where's my client

26
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,120
They are all relatively large amounts

27
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:33,799
Not very suitable

28
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:34,960
Our current Xiaotu

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Unlike our manager Zhao

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,240
Where's your client

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,319
All Pratt & Whitney customers

32
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,400
Then just give a few of them

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,199
Also

34
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,240
Who usually

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,400
In the office it's always

36
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:43,840
Come

37
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:44,960
Call me Brother Zhao

38
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,240
Let us at every turn

39
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,639
Little Brother Zhao, Little Brother Zhao shouted

40
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,520
What about now

41
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,799
backed out

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,919
flinched

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,960
Quit

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,599
Not like our manager Zhao

45
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,599
Xiao Tu

46
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,799
Little Brother Zhao

47
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,520
I've already prepared it for you

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,039
You see, I'll just say it

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,400
Here's what I've done earlier correctly

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
Basic materials of three companies

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,120
The financing plan is around five million

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,960
Take it and try it

53
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,919
Is this not so good

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,319
What's so bad about this

55
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,759
Why don't you quickly thank you, Brother Zhao

56
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,680
Thank you, Brother Zhao

57
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,840
Actually, I recently

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,000
Also contacted a company

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,919
shipyard's

60
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,919
It's just the beginning

61
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,599
Still don't know what's going on

62
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,560
This is like this

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
As long as the other party's qualifications are not bad

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,599
Let's work hard and fight for it

65
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,079
By the way

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,520
Be a customer

67
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,079
It's the same as asking for a debt

68
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't expect the other party to take the initiative

69
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,680
We have to take the initiative ourselves

70
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,759
Good

71
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,599
check

72
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,280
Interest

73
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Thirty-two

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,079
Mosquito meat is also meat

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,400
Keep

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,759
Why are you looking at me

77
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:27,960
I haven't officially congratulated you yet

78
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,999
The written test went smoothly

79
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,520
Congratulations to Xiao Tu

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,400
Thank you

81
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,119
There are no weak soldiers under a strong general

82
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,119
Main

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,960
Can't embarrass Mr. Ji

84
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:41,720
Is it just Mr. Ji

85
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,280
What else could there be

86
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,160
What do you want to do

87
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,720
That Mr. Ji and Xiao Tu

88
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:56,999
What else can I do

89
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,880
Thank you Mr. Ji for your encouragement

90
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:06,960
I went to work

91
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:20,880
During this time of preparing for the exam

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,200
Thank you for your hard work

93
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,960
Buy coffee for everyone

94
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Thank you

95
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,999
Thank you Xiao Tu

96
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,559
Thank you Thank you

97
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:38,840
Xiao Tang

98
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,640
I don't drink this flavor

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,840
Thank you

100
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,160
Xiao Tu

101
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm sleepy right now

102
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,599
You can drink two drinks in one go

103
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,160
OK

104
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,880
Thank you

105
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:58,439
By the way

106
00:05:59,119 --> 00:05:59,880
Did you buy it for the leader

107
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,999
And a cup of Aurui White

108
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,160
Good

109
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,760
Senior brother doesn't drink Aorui Bai

110
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,640
In addition to American style

111
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,640
Don't touch anything

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,599
Mr. Ji

113
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,080
Do you have mine

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,960
I'm sorry

115
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
Only one cup of Aurui White left

116
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:19,999
Give it to me

117
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:20,559
It's okay

118
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,720
Not senior brother

119
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,280
That cup is Auris white

120
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:30,679
It tastes pretty good

121
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,039
Thank you

122
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,479
You're welcome

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,119
As powerful as Mr. Ji

124
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,599
A man with such a good temper

125
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,479
I don't know in the future

126
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,720
Who is it cheaper

127
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,200
Beautiful and excellent

128
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,640
It has to be an entry condition

129
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,200
Isn't that a good deal for me

130
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,880
You're real

131
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,239
Do you only like to drink American style

132
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,320
Of course

133
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:02,840
Then why are you today

134
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,280
Drink the Aurui white I bought

135
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,799
I'm afraid of waste

136
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,960
Fear of waste

137
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,039
That's my money

138
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:10,919
What are you afraid of wasting

139
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,280
Your money. That's my money, too

140
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,799
And now our money

141
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,679
Is common property

142
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,559
What's more

143
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,200
You bought it

144
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,400
Can that still taste bad

145
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,200
You hurry

146
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,919
Send the milk to Mom

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,239
I'll go up

148
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
Check customer information

149
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:36,919
Soon

150
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:37,999
Independent development customer

151
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,119
Do you have confidence

152
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,960
Even if you have confidence, you won't meet your performance

153
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,799
Or make a few more phone calls

154
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,479
It's more practical to attract a few customers

155
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,400
Can I help you

156
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,320
Need not

157
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,239
Definitely not use it

158
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,599
The two of us

159
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,720
But there's an agreement

160
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,119
We are competitors

161
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm not gonna throw in the towel

162
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,919
You don't have to give me a green light

163
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,359
Don't worry

164
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,039
I will rely on my own strength

165
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:00,599
turned regular

166
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,160
Okay

167
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,799
Then I'll leave you alone

168
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,919
I'm going to read books too

169
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:07,039
Done

170
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,840
Didn't you go to read a book

171
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,640
Why so quickly

172
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,280
Have you warmed up a glass of milk

173
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,280
Thank you

174
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,599
I have lost weight recently

175
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,520
How about skim milk

176
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:33,359
Go ahead

177
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,119
Go ahead, go ahead

178
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,640
This cup is fat-free

179
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,559
Drink it while it's hot

180
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,239
Then you put it there

181
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,280
I'll drink it in a minute

182
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,039
I want to watch you drink

183
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,840
quick

184
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,439
Drink it while it's hot

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,360
Good

186
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,480
Then you go

187
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,199
Hiding what

188
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,600
Yuheng

189
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,679
Xiaoning

190
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:23,799
Are you guys asleep

191
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,319
Didn't sleep mom

192
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,919
What's wrong

193
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,039
This medicine I took before

194
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,959
Finished eating

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,079
I didn't find the new one. Where is it?

196
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,439
I put it next to the cupboard

197
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,559
I'll get it for you

198
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,280
No, no, no

199
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,760
I can take it myself

200
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,839
You guys go to sleep

201
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,600
Why don't I go

202
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,480
I'll go I'll go

203
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:43,880
Hate

204
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,079
Sister Jing

205
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,799
I contacted

206
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,919
Shipyard in Xihai Town

207
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,439
They want to expand into new business

208
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,640
Need a sum of funds

209
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,839
The amount is quite large

210
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,480
I got in touch with their accountant

211
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,160
Wednesday to

212
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,240
Do you have anything to tell you

213
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:08,799
That sister wishes you all the best

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,520
Their company qualifications are not bad

215
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,559
I think the loan

216
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,400
It should be approved

217
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,520
If it's done

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,640
That

219
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
This customer amount is mine

220
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,919
Most of the performance is yours

221
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,839
Book tickets for sister

222
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,199
OK

223
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,480
Xihai Town

224
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:54,959
Business trip application

225
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,719
Last night

226
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,880
Why didn't you tell me a word

227
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,199
It wasn't decided last night

228
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,760
I'll go with Sister Jing

229
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,919
Five days in total

230
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,679
Mr. Ji, please approve it

231
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,919
Our business trip application

232
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,880
Five days

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,959
I'm leaving on Wednesday

234
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,719
Right

235
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,400
Go early

236
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,839
Do you prepare early

237
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,520
Xihai Town

238
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,880
It's an island over there

239
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,640
It's very windy

240
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,719
The temperature is relatively low

241
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,280
Remember when I went

242
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,559
Bring more thick clothes

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
As a leader

244
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,400
You shouldn't be worried

245
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Have I been able to succeed in

246
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,480
Customer expansion

247
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,520
Work Aspects

248
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm not too worried

249
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,640
But if you have any

250
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,280
I don't understand, I won't

251
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,400
You can always ask me

252
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,280
24-hour hotline

253
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,120
Open for you

254
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,079
Got it

255
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:45,400
Go ahead

256
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:55,319
Xihai Town

257
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,000
Seasickness is much more uncomfortable than motion sickness

258
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,640
sister

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,480
I don't see anything wrong with you

260
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,319
I'm used to it

261
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,679
Get used to it

262
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,839
You used to take a lot of boats

263
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,600
Mobile phone

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,480
Where are you

265
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,559
One hour to dock

266
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,480
The first day without Ji Yuheng

267
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,760
Miss him

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,480
Fall in love

269
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,199
No, no

270
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,319
Ordinary friends

271
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:55,799
Sister Jing

272
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,799
I'm a little dizzy

273
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,439
Seasick

274
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,799
Let me go down and blow the wind

275
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,199
Isn't this just the wind blowing

276
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,160
Hello Xiaoning

277
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,480
Did you find any medicine

278
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,679
Found it

279
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,880
They've all been eaten

280
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,360
That's good

281
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I was in a meeting just now

282
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,280
I forgot to tell you in advance

283
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,919
This seasickness medicine is put in

284
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,640
It's the outermost part of the bag

285
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,000
Mr. Ji

286
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,039
You're so busy

287
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,439
How can I still take into account

288
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,760
So many little details

289
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,160
Do you miss that a little bit

290
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,439
I'm an outstanding one

291
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:31,439
Life Assistant

292
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
What does laughter mean

293
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,280
Is it there or not

294
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,520
Have

295
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:41,640
Okay

296
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,799
That's here

297
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,039
Tell me in time

298
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:45,719
Rice Go Hotel, right

299
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
How do you know

300
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,160
Right

301
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,559
That small town

302
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,679
There's only one hotel, right

303
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,439
I'm here

304
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,559
Send you WeChat

305
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,559
Good

306
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,039
Are you working

307
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,360
Go ahead and get busy

308
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,000
I hung up

309
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,240
You hang up first

310
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,160
Bye

311
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,319
Bye

312
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:09,839
Mr. Ji

313
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,760
Just now, the president

314
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,719
I forgot to give you a piece of information

315
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,400
Thank you for your work

316
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,559
Hello

317
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,319
A bottle of milk and a loaf of bread

318
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,000
Ten dollars

319
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:46,439
Boss, give me a bottle of water

320
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,360
Three pieces

321
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,559
So clever Xiaoning

322
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,799
You're here too

323
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,719
What a coincidence

324
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,319
You won't go to Xihai Town too

325
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,959
Yeah

326
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,079
Let me talk to a client

327
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,799
Then your customer is in the manufacturing industry

328
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,799
Couldn't they also build ships?

329
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,679
You guessed it all right

330
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:07,640
However, the shipyards in the West Sea

331
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,199
Not much either

332
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,880
We're not going to the same place, are we

333
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:12,760
The owner of the shop I went to was surnamed Yang

334
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,160
It's really a family

335
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:18,959
But

336
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,199
You may have to waste your trip

337
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,160
This is from me to the development department

338
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,240
First credit customer

339
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,480
I absolutely wouldn't

340
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,400
handed over to others

341
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,039
Don't let

342
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Let's each rely on our own skills

343
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:29,839
Okay

344
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,880
I'll see you later

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,360
Sister Jing

346
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,280
ID card

347
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,040
And the room card

348
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,321
Sister Na Jing

349
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,961
Sister Xiaoning

350
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,040
I'm going back to my room first

351
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,120
Have a good rest

352
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,721
She has so many resources

353
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,760
But it happened that I was interested in it

354
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,961
You have this client

355
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,481
It's interesting

356
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,601
The contract hasn't been signed yet

357
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,000
Not mine either

358
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:27,880
Is everyone playing fair

359
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,681
The mentality is quite good

360
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,160
This client is a

361
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
personal investment

362
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,561
No other shareholders are involved

363
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,601
Just right for you now

364
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:36,841
Take it to expand customers

365
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,441
But the company's qualifications

366
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:39,561
Be sure to review it carefully

367
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:40,160
Good

368
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:41,240
Let's be honest

369
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,081
Is it already

370
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:43,000
Have you thought of something

371
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,441
There is really no way

372
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,640
But their financial manager said

373
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,240
You'll have time to see us until the day after tomorrow

374
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,880
How about we now

375
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,240
Just rush into their company

376
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:53,441
Take a head start

377
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,280
Maybe

378
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,441
What's the windfall

379
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:56,481
Well

380
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:57,760
How to do it

381
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,160
Not brilliant

382
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,520
But it's better than

383
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:01,441
Positive

384
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,601
That is to say

385
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:04,681
Can it be used

386
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:11,120
Manager Tu

387
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:12,000
Unexpectedly

388
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,360
You guys just arrived and came over

389
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,360
Look at what I'm preparing here

390
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,160
Not quite sufficient either

391
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,280
Manager Liu, you said last time

392
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,921
Enterprises should expand their scale

393
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,921
Probably can provide

394
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:21,481
Two hundred jobs

395
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,321
I was

396
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,321
Follow the industry immediately

397
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:24,280
Reported the matter

398
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,481
The industry pays special attention to

399
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
I hope I can help you

400
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,240
Solve this urgent need

401
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,881
So our manager Rao also came

402
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,201
Hello

403
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
If Mr. Yang is here

404
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
We can talk

405
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,320
Details of the loan package

406
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:36,600
If there is any problem

407
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,000
Manager Rao can solve it face to face

408
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,080
This

409
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:43,881
Manager Tu

410
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,520
Look at it

411
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:45,800
We've been talking for so long

412
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,121
You can be considered an acquaintance

413
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,681
I'll tell you the truth

414
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,681
Coming and going these two days

415
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:51,641
They're all from the bank

416
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Mr. Yang

417
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,201
He thinks it's too troublesome to meet

418
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,840
It's just a plan

419
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,760
At the end of the day

420
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm just a finance guy

421
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:01,040
What does the boss decide in the end

422
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:01,560
Is it right

423
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,641
He wouldn't discuss it with me either

424
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,681
Then look

425
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,080
That's our Mr. Yang's

426
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,681
Godson Yang Jie

427
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:08,161
The girl next to me

428
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:09,520
I guess it's from which bank

429
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:16,600
How about this, Manager Tu

430
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,361
Where do I put your plan

431
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,641
Transfer to Mr. Yang

432
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,800
If

433
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,840
He has the intention

434
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,881
I'll contact you then

435
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,361
Don't bother, Manager Liu

436
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,681
Our plan

437
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:27,441
There are some problems in it

438
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,000
Or directly meet Mr. Yang face to face

439
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,121
It would be better to discuss it

440
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,361
Thank you

441
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:32,040
OK OK OK

442
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:32,961
That

443
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,641
I still have a job

444
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:34,681
Are you busy

445
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:35,320
Good

446
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,600
Why don't you give him the plan

447
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:45,881
You heard it just now

448
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,520
Recently

449
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,881
There are so many people sending plans

450
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:50,320
If I give him that plan

451
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:52,201
I guess Mr. Yang just flipped through it casually

452
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,641
Doesn't leave any impression

453
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,800
Exactly

454
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:56,760
They receive so many

455
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,000
No decision is made on the plan

456
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,600
All you want is

457
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,520
Between banks

458
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,000
Have a jurisdiction over each other

459
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,881
Finally win one

460
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:02,681
The best scheme

461
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,481
So what

462
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,840
This trump card in your hand

463
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,481
As long as it doesn't light up

464
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There's still a chance to win

465
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,921
I will definitely find a way

466
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:09,881
To meet Mr. Yang

467
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:27,520
be reasonable

468
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:28,961
People's responsibility to understand the law

469
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:29,721
be reasonable

470
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:31,000
People's responsibility to understand the law

471
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,161
Be reasonable and understand the law

472
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,520
Planning to take the public exam

473
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,000
Mr. Ji

474
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:37,641
That is

475
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:38,681
Have this plan

476
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,760
The president knows

477
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,520
And always reminds me

478
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,520
Let me go when I'm not driving

479
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,280
Pay close attention to study

480
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:44,641
Examination in different places

481
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,681
It's quite difficult

482
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,320
You have to work at ordinary times

483
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a lot of pressure, isn't it

484
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,320
It's really difficult

485
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,361
I just opened the book this evening

486
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:52,280
Eyelid fight

487
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:53,721
But it's okay

488
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,201
Be able to talk to someone you like

489
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,201
Stay in a city

490
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:56,881
Worth

491
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,681
Refuel

492
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,641
Mom

493
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,760
Xiaoheng

494
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:23,560
Still busy

495
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,681
Are you looking for me for something

496
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,121
Where today

497
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,280
My mother-in-law accompanied me for a stroll

498
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:32,840
The salesman said

499
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,121
Talk about this dress

500
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,760
The version is particularly good

501
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,040
Extremely comfortable to wear

502
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,201
I just bought you one

503
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,161
You bought it for me

504
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:44,800
Good

505
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:45,641
Thank you Mom

506
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,481
Try

507
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,280
No

508
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,320
I'll be on my own later

509
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,881
Go back and try it

510
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,161
You put it on

511
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,641
Should Mom have a look

512
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,121
Good

513
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,760
My God

514
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,161
Why is it so much bigger

515
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,881
OK

516
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:13,481
OK

517
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,161
My mother-in-law has reminded me

518
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:17,361
Say if it will be big

519
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,040
I was thinking

520
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:21,921
I was thinking about when you went to college

521
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:23,881
People have grown so much taller

522
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,121
Clothes always need

523
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,080
One size bigger

524
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,401
I didn't expect it to be so much bigger

525
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:31,240
Didn't you say that too

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,240
This since high school

527
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,681
You never bought me any more clothes

528
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,760
This

529
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,040
Also okay

530
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:37,840
Can wear

531
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,361
I'll change one for you tomorrow

532
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:44,040
Take it off

533
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:44,921
I really don't need it

534
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,161
No need

535
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,000
Change one

536
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,240
You can wear it again later

537
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:52,600
You

538
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:53,881
If you really go out by yourself

539
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,921
I'm not at ease either

540
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:55,921
We won't change it

541
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:01,401
Okay

542
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,881
Then I'll go wash first

543
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,681
Thank you Mom

544
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,040
Hello

545
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:22,840
It's me

546
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,881
Hello

547
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,280
Mr. Ji

548
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,921
How

549
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:27,760
Sounds like you're still busy at work

550
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,921
I'm modifying a loan package

551
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:31,481
What about you

552
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,161
What are you doing

553
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,441
I just got out of the shower

554
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:36,401
What a shame

555
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't have this eye blessing

556
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:38,560
If you give me

557
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,481
Just play the video

558
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,361
Sounds like

559
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:42,760
Rao Jing doesn't seem to be here

560
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,760
Sister Jing went out

561
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,040
The night in the West Sea is very beautiful

562
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,280
And there are a lot of small bars

563
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,080
Do you want to video it

564
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:56,240
Wait for me

565
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:33,441
What are you laughing about

566
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,760
What are you laughing about

567
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,361
I laugh at your disheveled clothes

568
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:38,481
improper

569
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,641
How are you busy at work

570
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:42,560
It went quite smoothly

571
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,161
Went to their workshop in the afternoon

572
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,600
Loan scheme

573
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,760
Preparations went pretty smoothly, too

574
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,921
Strive for an early date

575
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:49,881
Meet them, Mr. Yang

576
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,760
Sounds like it's going pretty well

577
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:58,000
What are you doing

578
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,921
Pajamas, of course

579
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,721
Then you change it

580
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:04,441
I don't watch

581
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,881
Wait for me

582
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:19,040
Done

583
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,201
So it's invisible

584
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,921
Why don't you answer?

585
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,201
I, I have something else to do

586
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,240
You go to bed early

587
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,401
Must be by Ling Weiyi

588
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:19,240
The belt is broken

589
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:20,840
What a shame

590
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,000
mysterious

591
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:33,240
Pajamas

592
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,721
What about the dry hair cap

593
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,600
Hello, hello

594
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:48,240
Is it Tu Xiaoning

595
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,161
It's me

596
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:51,320
Here's your flash

597
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:52,520
Come and pick it up

598
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,161
I didn't call Flash Delivery

599
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,201
It says you

600
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,600
Xihai Town Miguo Hotel

601
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:01,040
Then you put it there

602
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,080
I'm coming to get it now

603
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,800
Thank you

604
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:03,520
Okay

605
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,481
The first day without Tu Xiaoning

606
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:39,721
Miss her

607
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,721
Manager Liu

608
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,760
Please

609
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,361
Why don't you let me meet Mr. Yang

610
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:00,600
After meeting

611
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
If he rejects my plan

612
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,641
I will never bother him again

613
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,441
Can you see this Mr. Yang?

614
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,681
I'm truly saying it doesn't count

615
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm sorry

616
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,320
Then make a phone call

617
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,161
One minute

618
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,641
I just need a minute

619
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,921
Hello, how do you do

620
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,121
Is it Mr. Yang

621
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,560
I'm Tu Xiaoning from Dairui

622
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:26,161
Would you please give me a minute

623
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,560
Introduce my own scheme

624
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,520
I'm sorry

625
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:29,240
Busy

626
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,040
Goodbye

627
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:37,760
Hello

628
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
The user you are calling is busy

629
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,121
Would you please call again later

630
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,161
Sorry

631
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
The user you are calling is busy

632
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,760
No, no, no, no

633
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,280
You can take it

634
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:54,840
Really no need

635
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,760
It's okay if you take it

636
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,040
That Mr. Yang

637
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,280
When do you get off work

638
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,161
Mr. Yang

639
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:02,481
Mr. Yang

640
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:04,320
Isn't this Mr. Yang's car

641
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:06,721
Mr. Yang gets off work at this time every day

642
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:07,721
Thank you

643
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:23,721
Be open-minded

644
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,481
Working as an account manager

645
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,520
Who hasn't fallen a few stumblings

646
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:31,401
that

647
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:32,760
Manager Liu thinks I'm pitiful

648
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,000
And whispered to me

649
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:35,560
Tang Yuhui

650
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,361
I've been in touch with Mr. Yang recently

651
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,560
It is estimated that these days

652
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
It's time to sign the contract

653
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,161
I inquired about it

654
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:44,681
Yang Jie, the adopted son of Mr. Yang

655
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,520
It was once Tang Yuhui

656
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,641
A friend in the study abroad circle

657
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,000
I knew it when I was in the lobby

658
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,600
Resources

659
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,080
More Important Than Effort

660
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:54,361
Lost once

661
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,520
I didn't expect

662
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:56,641
Lost again this time

663
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,441
But

664
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,080
Losing to God doesn't count as losing

665
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,040
You weren't born in a

666
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,641
You can take it out casually

667
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:07,320
Ten million families filling holes

668
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,161
No chance

669
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,481
Being in a study abroad circle

670
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,760
To meet someone's godson

671
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,000
This is a random arrangement from God

672
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:15,121
It's not your human error

673
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,921
Thank you Sister Jing for comforting me

674
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,760
What about my principles

675
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:21,080
That is

676
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,921
Timely stop loss

677
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,681
Whether it's your own personal emotions

678
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:24,401
Or consume in

679
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:25,481
Energy in Customers

680
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,840
I got it

681
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,721
Hello

682
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:39,760
Sister Jing

683
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:41,201
The restaurant next door said

684
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,681
Today's seafood is particularly fresh

685
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,881
You take Sister Xiaoning with you

686
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:44,721
Let's come together

687
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,080
Xiaoning

688
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,760
She's already asleep

689
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,600
Let me go to eat with you

690
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:53,080
OK

691
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:55,280
I'll see you soon

692
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:56,201
I'll see you soon

693
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:00,760
Have a good rest

694
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,040
Gone

695
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,681
Xiaoning

696
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,881
You've been in the business for so long

697
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:33,240
Why can't you see clearly

698
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:35,040
Resources and Connections

699
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,080
Far more important than diligence

700
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,161
I inquired about it

701
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:40,560
Yang Jie, the adopted son of Mr. Yang

702
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,441
It was once Tang Yuhui

703
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,760
A friend in the study abroad circle

704
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I didn't think you liked it

705
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,401
Eat these little roadside barbecues

706
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,881
Sister Jing

707
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm actually

708
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:19,080
Very easy to get along with

709
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:21,201
What about you, if you want to know more about me

710
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,080
You will find us both

711
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,520
Actually, they have a lot in common

712
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,840
Benefit first

713
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,000
unscrupulous

714
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,921
These two points are quite like mine

715
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:34,000
Don't get me wrong

716
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,161
These two words are here with me

717
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:35,921
Not a derogatory term

718
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:38,961
Sister Jing

719
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,040
You are in the development department

720
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,401
But a legend

721
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,840
We are here to meet our customers this time

722
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,641
You should also see

723
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:46,481
My ability

724
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,600
I have resources

725
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:49,840
You have experience

726
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:51,641
As long as you are willing to take me

727
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,600
Our two powerful alliances

728
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,280
It must be the best result

729
00:31:57,681 --> 00:31:59,040
Self-righteousness is the most like me

730
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:01,881
Come

731
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:02,721
Drink a

732
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:11,121
Sister Jing

733
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:14,481
I really want to work with you

734
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,800
I understand

735
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:18,721
Originally, I thought

736
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:20,121
You come and we expand a part

737
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:21,800
He came for Ji Yuheng

738
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:24,560
But I didn't think I looked down on you

739
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,881
People are self-motivated

740
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:27,641
Not a bad thing

741
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,121
But you have to remember

742
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:30,520
Not anyone else

743
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,560
Can be dragged here by you

744
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,441
As a stepping stone

745
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,121
And

746
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,921
Today's meal of wine

747
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:37,320
Sister invited

748
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,161
You drink slowly

749
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,280
What's wrong with you

750
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:47,161
sullen

751
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,240
I thought

752
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:50,121
I'm a lucky man

753
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,401
Successfully passed the full-time examination

754
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,681
Found it again smoothly

755
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:54,760
First Customer

756
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:56,481
The result is still

757
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:59,000
Draw water with a bamboo basket and it's all in vain

758
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,681
Isn't it just a client

759
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:03,481
At worst, I'll ask my dad to let him

760
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,641
I'll give you a small loan of tens of millions

761
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,280
Let him pull two more of his friends

762
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,121
Maybe hundreds of millions

763
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:08,161
Then let me

764
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:09,320
Wouldn't he become the vice president?

765
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:10,641
I'm walking sideways in Dairy

766
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,080
When the time comes, Ji Yuheng and I

767
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,040
Things about falling in love

768
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,240
Do they have to send red envelopes

769
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,121
Give us a celebration

770
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:18,481
Of course

771
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,921
I'll hang up later

772
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:20,921
I'll call my dad

773
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,040
Forget it

774
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,800
Don't listen to the wind and rain

775
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:26,441
I'm just kind of

776
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:28,600
I doubt myself

777
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,361
Don't worry

778
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,441
It's nothing

779
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:33,401
Weiyi

780
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:35,000
How about this set

781
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:36,840
See your uncle appear more dignified

782
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,121
It's too old-fashioned

783
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:39,401
Just like my uncle

784
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,161
The blue one just now is better

785
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,641
All right, all right

786
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:43,401
You guys keep busy

787
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,080
I'm tired, too. I went back to sleep

788
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,481
Xiao Ning, goodbye

789
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,600
He wandered around his

790
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,840
Let's talk about us, don't worry about him

791
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:49,800
Make another appointment when you go back

792
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,401
I hung up

793
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:12,560
Ji Yuheng

794
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,000
I miss you so much

795
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:31,961
Xiaoning

796
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:52,801
Why are you here

797
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:08,441
It's okay

798
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,120
It's okay

799
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:12,241
I'm coming

800
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:23,481
How much you have eaten these two days

801
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:24,441
It's definitely not to taste

802
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:26,120
Look what I brought you

803
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,401
Egg yolk cake

804
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,040
And a lot of snacks

805
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:30,761
And this

806
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:32,441
Home downstairs

807
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:33,481
Seaweed Beckham

808
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:34,600
It's all your favorite food

809
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,801
Don't clean up

810
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,160
Come and sit for a while

811
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,160
Come here so late

812
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:45,281
Are you tired

813
00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:47,560
Of course I'm not tired

814
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,600
If I don't come

815
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I didn't even know you were alone

816
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,281
Shed tears secretly

817
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,600
I didn't shed any tears

818
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,040
I did that because I saw you

819
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:01,680
tears of joy

820
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,961
Then I'll say it again

821
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:08,481
After we finish the video

822
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,640
I suddenly miss you so much

823
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,200
I want to see you soon

824
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:14,441
Tomorrow is the weekend again

825
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:15,600
It's off work today

826
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,761
I rushed over

827
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,441
Then if you come over

828
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:24,881
Mom, what should I do

829
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,600
It's only been three days since I went downstairs

830
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,321
It's like a reunion after a long absence

831
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:45,080
The more you jump, the better

832
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:52,281
in-laws

833
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,160
Your community

834
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,120
It's really lively

835
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:56,361
I've recovered from my illness later

836
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,921
I'm here to play too

837
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,680
Good

838
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,680
Play that

839
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,520
Top

840
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,241
Well then

841
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:03,120
I'm on the internet later

842
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,761
I'll buy one for you

843
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,200
Luminous all night

844
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm kidding

845
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:10,401
How can I have that energy

846
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,281
Can you smoke it

847
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:12,281
Where's my water

848
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:13,640
Didn't you take it?

849
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,801
Have a sip of yours

850
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,120
in-laws

851
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,481
You guys pick me up

852
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,080
Thank you so much

853
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,321
You see what you said

854
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,281
What are these words

855
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,720
You stay here

856
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,680
Xiaoji

857
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,120
Only then did I have time to find Xiaoning

858
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:26,000
Where's the two of us

859
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,600
Can sit here too

860
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,520
Speak in a down-to-earth manner

861
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:29,000
It's too late for me to be happy

862
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,241
That's true

863
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:32,801
Then back

864
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:34,200
Don't you either

865
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,560
The in-laws and in-laws are shouting that they are divided

866
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,321
How many years am I older than you

867
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,841
If you don't mind

868
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:41,680
Can I call you sister

869
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,441
That must work

870
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,281
My sister

871
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:49,761
What's wrong with you this is

872
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,321
What do you think is wrong with me

873
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,040
Come back tomorrow Come back tomorrow

874
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,640
Bye

875
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:01,761
This makes you jump

876
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:02,720
You don't jump

877
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,401
Then I'll

878
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,640
Then I'll have to dance with someone else

879
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,160
It's just dancing

880
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:09,241
Who says I don't jump

881
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:10,520
Go Sister

882
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,921
Let's go square dance

883
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:12,241
Go

884
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,481
Don't you dance with your father-in-law

885
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,921
How well he danced just now

886
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:16,520
Don't care about him

887
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:16,961
Let's go

888
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:19,441
I

889
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,281
Let me take pictures of you two

890
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:39,921
My mother's rhythm

891
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,600
It's basically no one

892
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:43,241
Will not be biased

893
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:44,801
Mom is so amazing

894
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:45,881
Such a strong sense of rhythm

895
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:49,040
Actually, my parents

896
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,321
So that we can get together

897
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,401
Take care of my mom

898
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,200
I appreciate it

899
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,160
My mom keeps saying

900
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,000
Want to have a sister

901
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,481
She must be particularly happy this time

902
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,841
There is a lot to talk about every day

903
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,281
Mom went to my house

904
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:01,921
Where's Nemo

905
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:03,200
Followed by one piece

906
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:04,921
When we get home

907
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,080
Pick it up again

908
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,120
Are you tired

909
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:19,281
Is it because

910
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,120
Tang Yuhui

911
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,241
I'm going to sign a contract with Mr. Yang

912
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,841
That's why you're crying

913
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:27,481
You got it

914
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,720
And it's not just because of this

915
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,680
I

916
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:34,040
I especially want to work hard

917
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,441
But Mr. Yang doesn't see me

918
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:39,720
I'm not convinced

919
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:41,321
But

920
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:42,801
I

921
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,841
Powerless

922
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,801
I feel frustrated

923
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
It's particularly strong

924
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:48,401
I feel useless

925
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:50,881
Xiaoning

926
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,080
Actually, I have channels

927
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:53,720
Can help you

928
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,680
Contact Mr. Yang

929
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,120
Need not

930
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,921
Didn't we agree

931
00:39:58,401 --> 00:39:59,761
Don't put the relationships in your life

932
00:39:59,761 --> 00:40:00,680
Bring to work

933
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,401
Besides, you are

934
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:02,680
The boss of both of us

935
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,761
Even if you don't use your current status

936
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:05,520
Help me get in touch

937
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:07,241
It's not fair to others either

938
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:10,481
Don't worry

939
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,520
I won't give up easily

940
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
This loan application

941
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,080
Haven't you reported it yet

942
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,441
I still have a chance

943
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:20,160
Without violating

944
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,481
Under the circumstances of your principles

945
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,321
Where there is any

946
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:23,281
Need my help

947
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,321
Be sure to tell me

948
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,680
Even if

949
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:27,080
It's beating me up

950
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:28,080
Decompression is also fine

951
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,321
You're not a sandbag

952
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,321
How can I beat you

953
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:34,281
Are the chest muscles trained for nothing

954
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:35,000
Try

955
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:36,720
I can't bear to part with it

956
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,921
Teacher Ji's figure

957
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,720
Still really good

958
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
You delivered this to your door yourself

959
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:27,961
Rao Jing

960
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,321
Hello Sister Jing

961
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:34,200
What's wrong with your voice

962
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,120
Are you dumb

963
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:37,481
I don't have a voice

964
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,160
What's wrong

965
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,321
No, what time is it

966
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:41,160
Where are you

967
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:42,361
You wouldn't

968
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:43,921
You're not going to block Mr. Yang again, are you

969
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:44,560
No no

970
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,720
Just jump into the sea if you don't think about it

971
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Will you come back in the evening

972
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:50,321
I'll lock the door if you don't come back

973
00:41:50,921 --> 00:41:51,241
return

974
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,600
I'll be right back

975
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:55,841
Hang up

976
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,281
Come back soon

977
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,640
This Tang Yuhui is really

978
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:14,560
Let a leader as big as me

979
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,160
Invisible

980
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,361
Have to get from the bank again

981
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:19,080
Move her over and sign a guy

982
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,040
Who

983
00:42:21,361 --> 00:42:22,401
Who else could there be

984
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,881
The one I'm most annoying with

985
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,640
Brother Zhao

986
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:28,361
Not important

987
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,600
Let me tell you, Xiao Tu

988
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:32,441
Doing marketing

989
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,000
If only brute force is used

990
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:35,361
Then you will die of exhaustion

991
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:36,241
In one's own persistence

992
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
What about the good client

993
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:39,000
Everyone wants to rob it

994
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:40,921
If the person you want to see

995
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:41,600
Can't see

996
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:44,761
You have to find a way

997
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:45,720
Let that person come to see you

998
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:48,241
Let him come to see me

999
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:49,841
Right

1000
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,200
Let him come to see you

1001
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,761
Remember to turn off the lights later

1002
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:57,441
Good

1003
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,961
fishing rod

1004
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,401
Are you sleeping

1005
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,241
Make an appointment for your time tomorrow

1006
00:43:14,921 --> 00:43:15,801
Be with you at any time

1007
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:33,481
Please come out quickly

1008
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:34,281
Hurry up

1009
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:43,441
Come on, come on, come on

1010
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:09,720
Thank you

1011
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:10,481
You're welcome

1012
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:11,200
I'll do it

1013
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,640
This pole is so heavy

1014
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,200
The wind and waves of sea fishing are too big

1015
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:18,000
The water is also deep

1016
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,560
So the rod has to be heavier

1017
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,401
There is also the most important thing

1018
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:23,321
You can't use those for fishing bait

1019
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:24,401
Earthworms and bugs

1020
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,120
Need to use this specially made

1021
00:44:26,921 --> 00:44:27,441
Choose one

1022
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:45,120
What's wrong

1023
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,160
It's okay

1024
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:47,080
Just pricked it

1025
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:48,321
Let me see

1026
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,520
It's okay

1027
00:44:51,761 --> 00:44:52,761
Why are you so careless

1028
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:55,160
It's okay

1029
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,281
I'm not that delicate

1030
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,921
You still carry this with you

1031
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,441
Of course

1032
00:45:04,361 --> 00:45:05,361
The fins are very hard

1033
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:06,881
Especially afraid that you will be pricked

1034
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,441
But I didn't expect

1035
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,281
The hook scraped you

1036
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:20,241
Come

1037
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,640
So be careful

1038
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,080
I'm not willing to let you get hurt

1039
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:28,401
Blame me too

1040
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,120
Should have warned you in advance

1041
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:19,401
Good night
