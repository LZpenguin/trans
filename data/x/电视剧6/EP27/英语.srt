[You Are My Secret]
[EP27]

3
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,920
There's something I need to tell you.

4
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm pregnant.

5
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,479
I took

6
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,640
the pregnancy test

7
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:56,840
as well.

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,560
I went to the hospital,

9
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,640
and had a blood test.

10
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,280
I... um...

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,319
The reason I didn't tell you

12
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,039
is that I thought

13
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,200
because of this baby,

14
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,959
our relationship

15
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,599
would definitely deepen.

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,759
But deep down,

17
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,039
I don't want us to be forced

18
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,160
to be tied together.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,879
And I really don't want

20
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,959
to use this child to tie you down.

21
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,640
You got it?

22
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,759
I didn't know

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,359
how to

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
explain this to you.

25
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,079
But

26
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,960
your actions today

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
make me feel

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,599
really secure.

29
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,479
And I believe

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,079
that you will

31
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,960
become a partner

32
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,359
that I can trust.

33
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:38,319
So,

34
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,599
if possible,

35
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,079
should we take

36
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,079
a step forward?

37
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,599
These

38
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:15,240
are all my debit and credit cards.

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,919
There are some savings in them.

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,440
You can take them out

41
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,680
and keep them yourself.

42
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,000
The large deposit certificates and

43
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,280
financial documents are all at my place.

44
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,479
Later,

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,079
let's transfer them to you.

46
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,879
And about my house...

47
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,560
Next week,

48
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,879
we can take a day off

49
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,000
to make

50
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,879
your name added thereupon.

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,400
Get it notarized.

52
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,039
The property rights will be shared.

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,799
If...

54
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,680
I mean,

55
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:44,599
one day

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,319
should I have an affair,

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
all property rights would go to you.

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
I would leave with nothing.

59
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,359
It sounds like

60
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,759
you're giving me

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
all your possessions.

62
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,400
Won't you

63
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,639
regret it?

64
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,240
No,

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,199
I won't.

66
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:30,999
Rao Jing,

67
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:35,640
I'll

68
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:38,999
definitely

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,840
try my best

70
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,760
be a good father.

71
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,599
and also strive to

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,599
be a good husband.

73
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,400
I love you.

74
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,919
Not because of the child.

75
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:00,880
But because of you.

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,479
Let's get married.

77
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,200
Let's get married.

78
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,320
Let's do it.

79
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,119
But listen,

80
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,999
you're not allowed to have any affairs.

81
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,799
If any,

82
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:39,880
all your possessions

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,760
will belong

84
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:42,919
to me.

85
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,160
Can't sleep, huh?

86
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,880
I was just thinking.

87
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:09,880
The romance

88
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:12,080
of Jing and Fanggang has gone public.

89
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,640
Will they...

90
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,479
Zhao Fanggang

91
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
has already decided to resign.

92
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,599
There have been rumors in the bank

93
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,559
that Mr. Xing and Yao Jia

94
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,160
are both going to face the penalty.

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,919
If our relationship

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,479
gets exposed,

97
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,119
will the two of us

98
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,280
also be punished?

99
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,200
Actually, whenever it involves

100
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,280
punishment,

101
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:39,160
there must be

102
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,200
serious violations.

103
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,720
Issues of conduct

104
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,520
are just the trigger.

105
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,160
In recent years,

106
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,039
they've colluded,

107
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,200
lowering interest rates

108
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,039
and reaching out to clients for benefits.

109
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,160
Such behavior

110
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,039
is absolutely intolerable in the bank.

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,080
However, we're

112
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,919
in a completely different situation.

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,960
Right.

114
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,359
I was so shocked that I got confused.

115
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,960
Now that Jing's relationship

116
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,280
was exposed,

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,160
as the supervisor,

118
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,439
you bear some responsibility.

119
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,320
If, at this moment,

120
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,520
our relationship

121
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:17,840
was also exposed,

122
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,359
it would give the impression

123
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,400
that S1

124
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,280
has serious issues.

125
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,320
They might think we're disregarding rules,

126
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:25,679
leading to a flurry of rumors.

127
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,439
Negative public sentiment could arise.

128
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,720
It could

129
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,679
impact your chances for promotion.

130
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,400
Even

131
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,640
maintaining your current position

132
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,679
might become quite challenging.

133
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:37,640
Therefore,

134
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:38,960
trying to hide from this issue

135
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,960
won't solve the problem.

136
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,960
We need to address it at its core.

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,320
Tomorrow, I'll speak with the president

138
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,720
to check on the progress of the promotion.

139
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,880
If I could successfully

140
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,280
get transferred,

141
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,840
it would benefit us,

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,679
and also Rao Jing

143
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,880
and Zhao Fanggang.

144
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:58,840
That's true.

145
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,840
To advance your career,

146
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,760
you surely need someone to support.

147
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
Having one of them on your team

148
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,280
would be beneficial.

149
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,679
Well,

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,960
whatever,

151
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,919
I hope our wishes come true,

152
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,280
and be able to

153
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,520
help Jing and Fanggang.

154
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,400
For now,

155
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
let's just not worry too much.

156
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,760
Hello!

157
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,320
Your food delivery is here.

158
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,559
Thank you so much.

159
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:30,960
No problem.

160
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,400
Why is the food delivery taking so long?

161
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,679
Have you heard?

162
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,479
Mr. Zhao from S1 is resigning too.

163
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,919
[So many lovebirds]

164
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,640
[have been exposed.]

165
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,520
[No office romance rule]

166
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,400
[will be reinforced again.]

167
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,120
[Exactly.]

168
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,640
Our delivery is here.

169
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:43,240
Come on.

170
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,120
How are you holding up?

171
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,319
I'm doing alright,

172
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,280
just feeling

173
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,919
a bit anxious.

174
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,360
I've been working for Dairui for 4 years.

175
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,919
If we

176
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,160
were to be discovered,

177
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,439
one of us would have to leave.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,280
No matter who it is,

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,400
I would feel a sense of loss.

180
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,839
I also realize

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,039
that I won't find

182
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
a job more suited to me

183
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,280
than this one.

184
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,839
I'm just a bit concerned.

185
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,520
I used to comfort you all the time.

186
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,799
Right now,

187
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,160
even I, as a receptionist,

188
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,240
am able to sense

189
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,240
the cold atmosphere

190
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,360
in this building.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
All I can do is

192
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,839
wish you all the luck

193
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,439
and pray that you won't get caught.

194
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:39,679
What are we having for lunch?

195
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,959
Let's just order something simple.

196
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,880
Sorry, I won't join you today.

197
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,039
I'm having lunch with my dad

198
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,160
at the restaurant next door.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,559
Go ahead.

200
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,400
I'll buy you something good another time.

201
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,079
Mr. Liu,

202
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,240
I understand completely.

203
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,959
However, the development of that land

204
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
is not something that can be rushed.

205
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
Yesterday, me and my team

206
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,760
worked with your people until 4:00 a.m.

207
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,799
Didn't they update you

208
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,839
on their plans?

209
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,959
Alright, alright.

210
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,880
No need to worry.

211
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,679
Let's talk about it this afternoon.

212
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,319
Alright?

213
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,799
Dad,

214
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,039
what else would you like to order?

215
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,120
Help yourself.

216
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm fine with anything.

217
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,799
Come on, put more thought into it.

218
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,079
[Yes.]

219
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,839
[Just call it]

220
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,600
["Star Residence Retirement Plan."]

221
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,160
[580,000 square meters,]

222
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,039
[a landmark complex.]

223
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,160
The only pure slab building in the area.

224
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,120
These points

225
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,360
need to be highlighted.

226
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,199
[Once the project proposal]

227
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:35,319
[is polished, just send it to me.]

228
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,160
[I'll take a look]

229
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,039
during my meeting breaks.

230
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,760
Has that loan not been repaid yet?

231
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,360
CC me on the email again.

232
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,480
I'll approve it right away.

233
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,559
Dad,

234
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,039
here, have some water.

235
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,439
I never realized before

236
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,839
how much effort you put into your work.

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,919
Recently,

238
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,959
I've saved up some money.

239
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,360
How about I treat you this time?

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,240
Let you experience the feeling of

241
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,839
being treated to lunch

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,000
by your daughter with her salary.

243
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,919
That's so sweet!

244
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:19,000
Alright then.

245
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,559
In my fifties, I finally get to enjoy

246
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,679
a meal my daughter is treating me to.

247
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:24,799
But let's agree in advance.

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,039
Could we keep the meal under 300?

249
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,000
Otherwise, my salary won't be

250
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,319
enough to cover my living expenses.

251
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,160
You called me here today,

252
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
and I was actually going to ask you

253
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,959
why you haven't used

254
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,039
the supplementary card I gave you.

255
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
What's going on?

256
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,600
Nothing.

257
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,160
I'd like to

258
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,039
try living

259
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,959
off my own salary

260
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:42,959
to support myself.

261
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,640
What made you come up with

262
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
such a strange idea?

263
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,719
Dad,

264
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,880
you know very well that

265
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
I'd just buy

266
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,000
whatever I wanted

267
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,839
without a second thought,

268
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:55,280
or even checking the price.

269
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,400
I just

270
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,799
did whatever I pleased.

271
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,120
But lately,

272
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,199
I've learned from Qi Yu that

273
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,640
making money

274
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,799
is really quite challenging.

275
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:05,319
Aren't you the same?

276
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,760
I used to think

277
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,319
that making money was easy for you.

278
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,039
But the truth is

279
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,640
that you even

280
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,679
got hard to sleep

281
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,919
or drink a glass of

282
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,919
water

283
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,719
because of work.

284
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,640
Recently,

285
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,360
with my own salary,

286
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,199
I've started to realize

287
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,439
the true value

288
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:26,199
of money.

289
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
How much effort is needed to earn money,

290
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,640
or how much you earn

291
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,400
determines how much you can spend.

292
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,679
I'm very clear about this now.

293
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,839
Listen to me,

294
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,439
I want you to experience working

295
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,679
to get a better understanding

296
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,280
of what money

297
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,120
means.

298
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,039
After all, in your generation,

299
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,679
it's harder to save money than to make it.

300
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,400
Alright.

301
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,559
I have seen

302
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,480
your efforts.

303
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:56,439
Having a basic understanding

304
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:57,240
is all that matters.

305
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,400
I don't want to see you suffer.

306
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,559
Look at what you've ordered.

307
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,640
My poor sweetie,

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,199
spicy pig trotters is your favorite dish,

309
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:04,959
and you wouldn't even order it.

310
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,439
Dad,

311
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,240
it costs

312
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,439
258 yuan.

313
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,240
My budget is only 300.

314
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,600
When spending money,

315
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,760
it should be done wisely.

316
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:26,319
Excuse me.

317
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,719
May I help you?

318
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,000
Spicy pig trotters, please.

319
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,360
OK.

320
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,120
Dad!

321
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,280
I've got that

322
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,839
258 covered.

323
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,039
Let's enjoy ourselves!

324
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,240
Dad, you're the best.

325
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,079
Love you.

326
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,240
It's tough to go from luxury to frugality.

327
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,360
Your way of saving

328
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,959
makes life difficult for yourself.

329
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,719
The real challenges are still ahead.

330
00:13:59,319 --> 00:13:59,839
Sir.

331
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,319
Hey.

332
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,280
I wasn't expecting your call.

333
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,199
Do you need something from me?

334
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,160
Did you come

335
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,199
without telling Weiyi?

336
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,439
No, I didn't.

337
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,919
I just ran up the

338
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,120
fire escape.

339
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,120
I heard you got accepted into the force.

340
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,559
Good.

341
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,079
You're definitely someone

342
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,360
who upholds their promise.

343
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:25,000
As for me,

344
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,319
I also stand by my promises.

345
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,480
I'll be fine with

346
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,880
you and Weiyi.

347
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,039
Thank you, sir.

348
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,880
I'll make sure to take good care of her.

349
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,679
You can count on me.

350
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,919
Can I?

351
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,360
She took me out

352
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,400
for lunch earlier.

353
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
She wouldn't even order

354
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,360
a dish she likes.

355
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,199
She is my only daughter.

356
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,120
Good for you!

357
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,120
Did you pull a fast one on me?

358
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,919
Are you that desperate to become

359
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,120
the president of the new branch?

360
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,799
It was you who leaked it

361
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:21,760
to my wife, right?

362
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,400
You got all the clients

363
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,799
to report me for taking kickbacks.

364
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,839
You taught them to do that, didn't you?

365
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,600
No, I didn't.

366
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,480
Mr. Xing,

367
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,760
action betrays secrets.

368
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,719
You'll inevitably

369
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:38,079
let your guard down

370
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,319
if you pull too many tricks.

371
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,719
When there're more people who dislike you,

372
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
naturally, someone will step up

373
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,439
to uphold justice.

374
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,079
I also dedicate

375
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,160
this statement to you.

376
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,839
Ji Yuheng,

377
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,719
you don't have to

378
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,760
admit to all those tricks.

379
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:01,039
I've

380
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,319
prepared a

381
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,400
parting gift for you.

382
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,400
Enjoy.

383
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,199
Jingjing.

384
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,280
Good morning.

385
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,199
XIaoning.

386
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,079
You okay?

387
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,959
Alright?

388
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,400
What's going on?

389
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,240
See for yourself, Xiaoning.

390
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,919
What is it?

391
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,719
It's OK.

392
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,160
We'll get some air.

393
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:26,560
Xiaoning,

394
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,320
let's go.

395
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,439
What's the matter with you?

396
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,600
You've kept this

397
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
from me the whole time.

398
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,959
Now it's all over the office.

399
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,999
Your team just had a scandal,

400
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:52,160
and as a supervisor, you...

401
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,600
Do you realize

402
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,320
how serious this is?

403
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,400
People are saying our conduct is improper

404
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,479
and management is chaotic.

405
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,479
Do you think you can still make

406
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,439
the president of the branch?

407
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,239
Just pray that you won't be punished.

408
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm sorry, sir.

409
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,959
I've let you down.

410
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,320
Regardless of what decision

411
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,279
by the headquarters,

412
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,519
I'll take full responsibility for it.

413
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,679
Anyway, the two of us

414
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,800
won't be able to work

415
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,759
on the same team anymore.

416
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
In the end, I'll be the one to leave.

417
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,600
That's a certainty.

418
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,279
But in your current situation,

419
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,439
transferring to another branch

420
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,400
won't be easy for you either.

421
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:35,719
Finding a job elsewhere

422
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:36,640
is also quite challenging.

423
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,800
But better than staying here, right?

424
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:41,999
Staying here,

425
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,560
I'll just be the subject of gossip.

426
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,759
As long as you're tough enough,

427
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,640
gossip won't hurt you.

428
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,239
Do you remember

429
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,679
what I told you in here?

430
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,479
Yeah.

431
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,679
You said,

432
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,239
women

433
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,999
should learn to take care of themselves.

434
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,239
Exactly.

435
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:03,919
The workplace has always been

436
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,519
tough on women.

437
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,519
So we don't need to

438
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,560
go easy on it.

439
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,919
Working is essential.

440
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,719
In times like these,

441
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,679
the most important thing is

442
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,719
to keep your job.

443
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,880
Got it.

444
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,959
What others say is their business.

445
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,519
We shouldn't let it affect us.

446
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,959
But I know

447
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,279
this process will be painful.

448
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,120
You need to prepare yourself.

449
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,279
[The left side.]

450
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:49,519
[A bit higher.]

451
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,880
I said the left side.

452
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,040
Raise a little.

453
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,239
Why did they keep it from me?

454
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,360
When Xiaoning first joined our team,

455
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,600
she didn't even know how to process a LC.

456
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,239
Who was the one kind enough to guide her?

457
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,560
When she faced challenges at work,

458
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
who was the one comforting her?

459
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,320
When she and Yuhui

460
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,519
were competing for performance,

461
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,999
who was the one having her back?

462
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,679
I treated her like a sister,

463
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,439
but what about her?

464
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,560
What does she see me as?

465
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,239
A colleague, of course.

466
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
What else could it be?

467
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,759
You two have no blood ties.

468
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,160
And what about Yuheng?

469
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,800
I worked seamlessly

470
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,679
with him.

471
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,679
He points, I follow.

472
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:29,080
And those two

473
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,640
were dating

474
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,080
right under my nose

475
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,679
without even telling me.

476
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:37,880
You didn't tell them about us either.

477
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,919
The one who hurts me the most is you.

478
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,759
We've shared a bed for so long.

479
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:50,919
I've entrusted you with

480
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:51,800
everything I have.

481
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,400
For such a big secret,

482
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,759
you didn't even share it with me.

483
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,040
Zhao Fanggang.

484
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,679
Anything that enters

485
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,719
your ears

486
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,719
will spread to the whole world.

487
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,679
Are you even aware that

488
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I consider you guys my family,

489
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
what do you see me as?

490
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:10,880
The biggest fool here is me,

491
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,040
'cause I was the one who tried to

492
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,080
set Yuheng up with Yuhui.

493
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:13,560
I...

494
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,600
am the clown in all this.

495
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,320
Anyway,

496
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,919
I'm leaving.

497
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:22,800
Xiaoning is leaving too.

498
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,880
The once happy family

499
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,640
is falling apart.

500
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,800
You and Yuheng

501
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:27,719
can rely on each other from now on.

502
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,719
It's off.

503
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,519
I rely on Yuheng, sure.

504
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:41,640
Let's go and

505
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,560
get divorced, shall we?

506
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,479
You told me that

507
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:53,840
Yuheng and I

508
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,239
could rely on each other.

509
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,120
It's chilly today.

510
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,239
Here, have some hot tea

511
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,120
to warm yourself up.

512
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:13,560
I've decided

513
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,759
to apply for a transfer tomorrow.

514
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,479
If no other branch is

515
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,320
interested,

516
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,400
I'm outta here.

517
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,239
If anyone's leaving,

518
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,800
it

519
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,919
should be me.

520
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:32,040
We had that bet.

521
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,560
Once you land

522
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,640
the contract

523
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,640
with Weiji,

524
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
you'll met the target

525
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,679
of doubling the

526
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,360
performance.

527
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,439
[But I]

528
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,360
[failed in bringing in]

529
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
[50 million deposits.]

530
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,040
Fair's fair.

531
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
I should be leaving.

532
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,160
I know you're

533
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:54,919
very capable.

534
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,360
But honestly

535
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,040
speaking,

536
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,600
if you left

537
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,759
section one

538
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,800
or Dairui,

539
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,199
it's gonna be

540
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,320
hard for you to

541
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,279
find a

542
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:09,800
satisfying job

543
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,279
you love as much.

544
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,160
So you can't give up.

545
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,519
It's me who should be leaving.

546
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,800
Yeah, I got it.

547
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,479
Jing also talked to me about it.

548
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,919
But a deal's a deal.

549
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,959
I can't hold you back

550
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,400
just 'cause I might not

551
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:24,959
find something better.

552
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,800
And let's face it,

553
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:28,959
you earn

554
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,239
several times

555
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,400
my salary.

556
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,279
Ain't fair for

557
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,439
the big earner to bounce

558
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,120
and the small fry to stick around.

559
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,279
You know, I'm all

560
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,919
about the green,

561
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,479
so it's

562
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,959
best for

563
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,120
me, for you,

564
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,600
and

565
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,479
for our family

566
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
if I'm the one to quit.

567
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,320
It's not set

568
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,600
in stone yet.

569
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,439
Let me handle this.

570
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:55,400
Okay?

571
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,519
Is there still room for that?

572
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,439
[Time flies,]

573
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,080
[eight months already.]

574
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,519
[This job is]

575
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,919
[your true passion.]

576
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,800
[So you can't give up.]

577
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,199
[I seem to]

578
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,279
[have fallen deeply]

579
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,800
[in love with my job]

580
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,600
[unconsciously.]

581
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,959
[Not for the title]

582
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,560
[or the security,]

583
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,919
[just]

584
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:10,959
[love.]

585
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,239
I used

586
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,560
to get off

587
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,479
before the crossing

588
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,479
and walk to work.

589
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,400
So it feels a bit strange

590
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:35,959
to get a ride

591
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,959
with you.

592
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,560
Our romance is out in the open,

593
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,679
there's nothing to hide.

594
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:47,999
Before, I felt

595
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,080
a little sad and

596
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
guilty about

597
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,600
our

598
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,120
special situation,

599
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,679
thinking it'd be

600
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:57,479
easier

601
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,880
when we are

602
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,400
not hiding,

603
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,279
and I'd feel

604
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,479
relieved.

605
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,880
But now, it's not

606
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:05,640
as freeing

607
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,999
as I thought.

608
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,400
Mind

609
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,320
dropping me at the next corner?

610
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:13,840
I wanna take a detour

611
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,880
and grab steam buns.

612
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,400
Really tasty.

613
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,320
Should I wait for you?

614
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,840
Nah.

615
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,439
Go on up.

616
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,439
One veggie and one meat

617
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,320
thanks.

618
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,199
Okay.

619
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,080
Wait.

620
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,439
Well...

621
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,719
Two meat then.

622
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:06,880
Thanks.

623
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,239
Xiaoning.

624
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,160
What a coincidence!

625
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,959
I'm sorry that

626
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,519
when you called yesterday,

627
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,320
I was swamped with work

628
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,120
and couldn't reply right away.

629
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:19,880
Sorry.

630
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,040
It's okay.

631
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,479
Tell me,

632
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,600
how did you

633
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,719
meet Mr. Ji?

634
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,160
He's such a great guy,

635
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,719
risking himself to

636
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,080
back you up.

637
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Rare breed.

638
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,560
Talented

639
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
and responsible.

640
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,040
Why work so hard?

641
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,719
Just be

642
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,880
a housewife,

643
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,679
it's way easier than

644
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:37,999
working yourself to death here.

645
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:39,999
Yesterday

646
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,120
he was the creep boss,

647
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
harassing women.

648
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,519
now you're all praises?

649
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,239
And back me up?

650
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,040
What do you mean?

651
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,160
You didn't see?

652
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,560
He put up

653
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,080
a post on site last night,

654
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:53,759
with your

655
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,880
wedding pic.

656
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,040
He said you were

657
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,360
together before

658
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,999
he joined S1.

659
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,719
And he came

660
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,120
at the boss's request,

661
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,959
to save the day.

662
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,040
So all that

663
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,840
gossip about

664
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:10,919
you using him

665
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,479
to get ahead

666
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:12,640
or whatever

667
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,919
is bullshit.

668
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,800
Thank you.

669
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,320
Hey.

670
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,160
Quitting?

671
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,479
Yeah,

672
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,120
that's why he's the boss.

673
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,519
Bold move.

674
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,840
He's giving

675
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,519
those gossipers

676
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,880
who accused Xiaoning

677
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,919
of playing dirty

678
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,840
a good slap.

679
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,400
They hit it off,

680
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:47,640
got

681
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,439
married

682
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:49,880
before

683
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,279
working together.

684
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:52,999
Morning.

685
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,600
Morning.

686
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,120
Xiaoning.

687
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,600
Morning.

688
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:56,880
Morning.

689
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:00,840
Decided?

690
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,040
I don't think Mr. Ji

691
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,560
will take my resignation.

692
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,959
I'll just give it straight to the president.

693
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,400
Mr Ji.

694
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:12,400
Since everyone's here,

695
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,239
I'd like to inform you

696
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,199
of a new personnel change.

697
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,400
The president signed

698
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,439
off on my transfer,

699
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,800
so today's my last day

700
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,600
here.

701
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,600
I've already

702
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,199
sorted out the handover stuff.

703
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,080
Tomorrow,

704
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,919
I will

705
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:37,919
leave S1.

706
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,679
I'm the one who should go.

707
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:58,080
Why quit without telling me?

708
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,719
Did you never

709
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,679
care about

710
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:02,040
our deal?

711
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,840
Were you just messing with me?

712
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,040
Calm down.

713
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,840
It's

714
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,199
my rivalry with S2

715
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,840
that

716
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,120
exposed our relation.

717
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,560
And because

718
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,479
I joined S1,

719
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,279
you were stressed

720
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,439
about our relationship

721
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,439
being revealed.

722
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,400
It's all my fault.

723
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:22,800
I'll take responsibility.

724
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,439
So from the beginning,

725
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,080
you signed that bet

726
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,360
to keep me from

727
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,439
worrying too much?

728
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,880
Nope.

729
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:34,999
Another thing,

730
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,400
I wanted you to show

731
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,439
what you're capable of.

732
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,080
What am I capable of?

733
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,360
I'm just a regular worker.

734
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,919
I'm nobody.

735
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,080
But you're

736
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,360
the boss's pick.

737
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,360
He'll flip

738
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,479
if you leave.

739
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,679
You know

740
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,479
the avoidance

741
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,759
rule,

742
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,439
right?

743
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:56,199
To stop

744
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,759
power trips.

745
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,600
You and Xiaoning

746
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,880
aren't married,

747
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,560
technically,

748
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,279
no rule broken.

749
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,880
But mixing work and love

750
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,800
can be messy,

751
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,040
it's hard to

752
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,080
clear your name.

753
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,800
With her rise

754
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,519
and the mess of S2,

755
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,199
rumors

756
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:18,959
fly

757
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,400
you're helping

758
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
her out.

759
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,679
Like you said, it's rumors.

760
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:25,759
I never misused

761
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,199
my power.

762
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,279
[She got no]

763
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,080
[special favors.]

764
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:31,640
Only equal deposits

765
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,640
quota from the gov.

766
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,600
Nothing else.

767
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,279
She

768
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,400
earned her

769
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,679
promotion and clients on her own.

770
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,880
Yes, I understand.

771
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,239
But she

772
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,120
really

773
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,080
has to leave.

774
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:53,719
No.

775
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,840
She shouldn't.

776
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:58,999
For her,

777
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,199
Dairui is more than

778
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:01,479
just a company.

779
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,120
She's fully invested in for her career.

780
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
I'm the one who should leave.

781
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:06,840
Sir.

782
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,600
I'll send

783
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,160
my transfer papers later.

784
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,880
Thanks for your

785
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,959
trust and care.

786
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:15,080
[So I told]

787
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,999
[the president]

788
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,479
how capable you are.

789
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,759
If you left,

790
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:20,679
it would

791
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:21,679
be a loss for S1.

792
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:22,959
[He thought it over]

793
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:24,999
and saw my point,

794
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,320
so he approved

795
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,880
my transfer last night.

796
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,880
He's not that easy to fool.

797
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:32,800
Really?

798
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,400
But

799
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,040
where to?

800
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:39,400
I haven't

801
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
heard of any vacancies

802
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
in the city.

803
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,479
Could it be demotion?

804
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,959
It's Nan'an branch.

805
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,040
Still a manager.

806
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Nan'an?

807
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,199
Over 2 hours away.

808
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:54,959
Yeah.

809
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:56,560
So far away.

810
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Is this a

811
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,160
punishment?

812
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,360
Of course not.

813
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,560
Nan'an branch is a mess,

814
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:05,320
lots of bad loans

815
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,560
dragging down performance,

816
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:08,880
ranking the last

817
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,279
in the province last year.

818
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,479
[And managers]

819
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,519
[have no motivation]

820
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,479
without bonuses.

821
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,000
It's a vicious cycle.

822
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,040
[So the higher-ups]

823
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,759
[want me]

824
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
[to work there]

825
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,319
[and fix it.]

826
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,080
And with all the drama,

827
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,679
sending me away

828
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,040
keeps me safe.

829
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:34,920
It's

830
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,480
a good thing,

831
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,239
grassroots experience.

832
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,719
Why?

833
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,359
You'll miss me?

834
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,359
Yeah.

835
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,160
It's

836
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,120
good for experience.

837
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:51,679
[And staying away]

838
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:53,839
keeps you out of trouble.

839
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,679
The president

840
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,399
values you by doing that.

841
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,399
But without this mess,

842
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,040
you

843
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,759
should have gone higher.

844
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:09,279
I'll

845
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,279
work hard

846
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:11,359
over there.

847
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,239
Just a pit stop,

848
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,120
I'll be back soon.

849
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
It's so far.

850
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,719
Don't worry too much.

851
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,759
[Thank you.]

852
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,600
[I bet]

853
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,759
[you'll get a better]

854
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:27,759
[partner soon.]

855
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,000
[See you.]

856
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,279
Heard you went to HR

857
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,319
to quit this afternoon.

858
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,719
There's a

859
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,879
new guy in HR,

860
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,359
I don't know much about him.

861
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:51,719
[He asked]

862
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,600
[if I only work with you,]

863
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,040
and

864
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,080
decided to leave

865
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:57,359
'cause you're gonna leave.

866
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:58,440
You won't

867
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,160
tell him this, huh?

868
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,679
You got me.

869
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,879
I ain't gonna tell them

870
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:04,199
I'm loyal to you.

871
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,319
Gonna make sure they know

872
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:07,440
I'm outta here

873
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,920
because of Rao Jing!

874
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,399
You got it.

875
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,600
It's tough for you too, huh?

876
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:42,920
Think

877
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:45,279
we'll ever be back here?

878
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,319
Your wife's here,

879
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,759
mine here too,

880
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,319
gotta come back.

881
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,679
We're

882
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,560
battle bros now.

883
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,160
Right.

884
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,120
You just quit,

885
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,879
got anything new cooking?

886
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,480
Nah.

887
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,239
My buddy's

888
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,399
got a finance gig

889
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,399
needs a short-term AM

890
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,359
with 5 years exp.

891
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,560
Pay's

892
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:25,399
decent.

893
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,879
I'll send his info

894
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:27,440
to you.

895
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:28,839
Might be a good temp thing

896
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,879
if you're interested.

897
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,239
Okay.

898
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,359
Thanks.

899
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,719
I'm out.

900
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,960
Don't miss me.

901
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:53,600
Boss!

902
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,160
Hit me up

903
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:57,600
if something opens up,

904
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,239
[I'll be in!]

905
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,120
Anyway,

906
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,879
Xiaoning's

907
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,279
drama's over.

908
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,480
No more hiding or worries,

909
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,480
she can date out

910
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,199
in the open now.

911
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,399
Ji Yuheng is really reliable.

912
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,359
But why's he

913
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,640
holding back?

914
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,839
If it were me,

915
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,759
I'd marry

916
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:28,920
Xiaoning right away.

917
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,879
To tie the knot

918
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:32,719
amidst all this chaos.

919
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,120
That'd be epic.

920
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:38,679
Weiyi.

921
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,120
You said

922
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,679
we should go

923
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,799
watch the sunrise sometime.

924
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,399
I checked,

925
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:44,799
Southern Mountain

926
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,480
is the best spot.

927
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,520
What do you think?

928
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,199
I think

929
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,120
it might be packed.

930
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,359
I'd prefer White Beach.

931
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,839
Why are you up so early?

932
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:12,279
It's only 5:30.

933
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,520
You gotta go at 6:00.

934
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,160
I wanna

935
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,440
pack something for you.

936
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,799
Okay.

937
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,920
All set, huh?

938
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,279
Water, wipes,

939
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,440
and socks? Why?

940
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,120
You need

941
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,040
4 hours

942
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,719
for commuting.

943
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,440
You might drink

944
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,080
with clients

945
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,160
at night and

946
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,440
not be able to make it back.

947
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,319
So I packed a shirt

948
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,000
and socks just in case.

949
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,399
I also put

950
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,560
a blanket in the car

951
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,319
for you to nap in

952
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:44,839
if you're tired.

953
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:47,799
You're so thoughtful.

954
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:48,640
Thanks.

955
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:50,799
But don't worry,

956
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,080
I'll be home,

957
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,679
unless it's a real emergency.

958
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:55,920
Great.

959
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,399
You passed the test.

960
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,640
How long's the gig?

961
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:03,560
Did your

962
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,920
boss give you

963
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,040
any hints

964
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:07,279
during the talk?

965
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:08,679
No clue.

966
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,160
Gotta fix

967
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,080
all the issues

968
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,759
and wait for

969
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:13,679
a spot here.

970
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,160
It's

971
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,120
unpredictable.

972
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,080
Take it easy.

973
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,399
Forgot to say,

974
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,160
two newbies joining today.

975
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:27,480
Since you and Fanggang

976
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,399
are leaving,

977
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,160
they're in today.

978
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,799
The chaos not over yet.

979
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:36,679
To put it bluntly,

980
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,960
I can at least

981
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,239
find some peace there.

982
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,239
But you might

983
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,279
hear some gossip

984
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,359
or rumors.

985
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,120
If you do,

986
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:46,520
don't let it get to you.

987
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,960
Just

988
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,399
some gossip.

989
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,600
Nothing compared to

990
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
the bad debts

991
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,719
in Nan'an.

992
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,799
Take

993
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,960
your time.

994
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,520
Life's bumpy,

995
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,199
full of ups

996
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,520
and downs.

997
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:04,960
We'll

998
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,960
ride it out,

999
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,960
slowly but surely,

1000
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:08,839
things will get better.

1001
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,520
Got it.

1002
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:15,319
Where's yours?

1003
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:16,600
On the

1004
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,520
bedside?

1005
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,560
Here.

1006
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,399
Xiaoning.

1007
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:30,600
Let's take a vacation

1008
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,640
after this mess.

1009
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,960
New job, new branch,

1010
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,520
and you wanna

1011
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,000
be off already?

1012
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:41,000
Okay.

1013
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,960
Well.

1014
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,040
I'll talk to Jing

1015
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,199
about it then.

1016
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,359
Here.

1017
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:35,719
Your coffee.

1018
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,640
With sugar cube.

1019
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:40,440
Give it a try.

1020
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:45,719
Not bad?
