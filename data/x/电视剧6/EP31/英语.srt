1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:41,080
You Are My Secret EP31

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,879
I've hinted at this so much already.

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,479
And you're still playing dumb.

5
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,239
Then I might as well be direct.

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,280
I respect you.

7
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,119
I hope you can respect me too.

8
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:04,640
I have a fiancé.

9
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,000
We'll be getting married soon.

10
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,920
No matter what was on your mind,

11
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,200
I can only say I'm sorry.

12
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,000
Are you referring to

13
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,679
Mr. Ji?

14
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,199
You know, Xiaoning,

15
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,240
the first time I met you,

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,039
I watched you

17
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,479
focusing on the printer.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,199
You observed that I like coffee

19
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,079
and don't enjoy tea.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,840
I thought you're an aspirant woman

21
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,520
who relied on your own efforts.

22
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,720
But you're smarter than I expected.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,359
Leveraging a close relationship

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
with the boss is indeed a shortcut

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,919
to accelerate your career path.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,160
Besides,

27
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,160
aren't you still not officially married?

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,240
Since you're a smart girl,

29
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,240
you should know

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,879
that I'm capable

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,039
of anything

32
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:45,960
he can provide

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,359
or he can't.

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,479
Although he's in charge of a branch,

35
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,479
he's just someone on the payroll.

36
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,400
But I'm different.

37
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,240
I returned from abroad

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,440
to manage such a large enterprise.

39
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,240
I need someone to help me

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,440
oversee internal operations.

41
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,000
We both have our needs to fulfill.

42
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,919
A fair arrangement, huh?

43
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,759
Are you finished?

44
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,720
Supposedly,

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
you are my client.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,199
I should show you respect.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,280
And I should do my utmost

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,639
to make our partnership work.

49
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,199
If you

50
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,840
don't like the proposal,

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm open to revisions,

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,440
no matter

53
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,079
how many times.

54
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,359
If it still doesn't

55
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,160
satisfy you in the end,

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,240
I guess I'll have to give in.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
We are in a partnership.

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,960
No more, no less.

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,400
You're saying I was leveraging

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,039
a close relationship with my boss.

61
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,560
Not only did you insult me,

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,479
but insulted my fiancé.

63
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,319
So,

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
I don't think you deserve

65
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,639
my respect.

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,840
Mr. Fu,

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,680
your behavior

68
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,280
has truly opened my eyes.

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,400
Xiaoning!

70
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,599
Xiaoning!

71
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,120
Wait a moment!

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,879
Behave yourself!

73
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,400
Is this your way of playing hard to get?

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,759
You know what,

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,319
I actually find that quite appealing.

76
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,359
It just fuels

77
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,599
my desire to conquer.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,359
Ji Yuheng!

79
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,119
I'm really sorry.

80
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,200
I screwed this up.

81
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,160
It's all my fault.

82
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,679
But you're a bit impulsive today.

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,799
I'm worried he might file a complaint.

84
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,200
You just became the president...

85
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,799
None of that matters!

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,359
Tu Xiaoning, you hear me?

87
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,119
To me,

88
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,280
your safety tops all others.

89
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,880
I won't let anyone hurt you

90
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,239
or bully you.

91
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,080
You have no idea

92
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,439
how deep and enduring

93
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,599
my love for you truly is.

94
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:26,760
Alright, alright.

95
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,119
I know.

96
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,080
Since a year ago,

97
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,720
when we met again...

98
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,039
Not just a year ago,

99
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,999
but eleven years ago.

100
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:42,960
Since our high school days,

101
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,359
the only girl I've truly loved

102
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:46,520
has been you.

103
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:52,999
Follow me.

104
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,400
Why did you

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,359
bring me here out of the blue?

106
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,479
Because this is the place where

107
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,039
I fell for you at first sight 11 years ago.

108
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,840
Xiaoning,

109
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,039
there are certain things

110
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:25,960
that I have to let you know.

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,439
In 2013,

112
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,039
on your birthday,

113
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,960
I made you a birthday gift, but

114
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,400
I never had the courage to give it to you.

115
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
It was a clay doll.

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Is it...

117
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,239
The one I've seen before?

118
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,320
Isn't that your dream girl?

119
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,520
That was actually you.

120
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,559
My dream girl

121
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,840
is you.

122
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:26,999
Actually, the first time I met you

123
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:27,599
was when

124
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,160
I was eighteen.

125
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,520
One afternoon,

126
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,439
after P.E. class,

127
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,400
you're drinking water by the pool.

128
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,720
Tu Xiaoning!

129
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:45,880
Let's go!

130
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:48,919
Coming!

131
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:49,960
Please.

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,080
That was the first time

133
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,119
I heard your name,

134
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,880
and laid eyes on you.

135
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,080
Tu Xiaoning.

136
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,080
Also the first time that

137
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:03,999
I realized what

138
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:04,999
it truly means to feel a heartbeat.

139
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
Then,

140
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,239
my father committed suicide.

141
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,999
It took me into

142
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,280
the darkest time of my life.

143
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,280
That evening, I was sitting there,

144
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,119
you showed up.

145
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,320
Kitty?

146
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,160
Don't!

147
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,160
Are you alright?

148
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,719
It shouldn't be injured.

149
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,839
I'm asking about you.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,839
Are you OK?

151
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:07,319
Ji Yuheng,

152
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:07,760
is that right?

153
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,839
I've actually heard

154
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,839
some things about you,

155
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:12,959
just occasionally from others.

156
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,199
I'm not very clear on the details,

157
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,199
but I wanna tell you that

158
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,120
you've got to look ahead in life.

159
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,280
Dwelling on the past

160
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,919
will only bring you loss,

161
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640
but focusing on the future

162
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,480
can lead to

163
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
all sorts of new gains.

164
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,839
You are like a ray of light.

165
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,400
That light illuminated my life

166
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,600
and saved me.

167
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:41,919
Later on,

168
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
I found myself unconsciously drawn to you.

169
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,799
In my eyes,

170
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:50,160
you're radiant,

171
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,959
warm,

172
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,559
and incredibly brave.

173
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,160
When we both went to college,

174
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,919
I could only catch glimpses of you

175
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,719
through messages

176
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,839
in our class group chat.

177
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,559
For a time, I missed you deeply.

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,799
So I made up my mind

179
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,360
to seek you out.

180
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
I went to your school,

181
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,039
but I was still late.

182
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:31,959
Kiss!

183
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,280
Then,

184
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,679
I went abroad.

185
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,559
Studying abroad alone,

186
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,000
and living on my own.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,079
But I still quietly

188
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,120
kept an eye on your updates.

189
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
One night,

190
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,240
I saw your new post,

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,319
saying you're back single.

192
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,120
Hey!

193
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,439
Please book

194
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,600
my return ticket as well.

195
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:33,719
The sooner, the better.

196
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,079
I booked a ticket as soon as I could.

197
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,000
I didn't want to miss out again.

198
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,319
We're about to meet,

199
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,839
Tu Xiaoning.

200
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,559
Then why didn't you

201
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,120
come to me when you just got back?

202
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,240
Because you mentioned

203
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,520
that you needed time

204
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,439
to sort things out.

205
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,199
So I didn't want to intrude.

206
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,559
Until later,

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,640
you wanted

208
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,000
to start a new relationship,

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,799
even looking for

210
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,280
a marriage partner.

211
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,000
I realized I couldn't wait any longer.

212
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
I didn't want to miss out again.

213
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,559
Thanks.

214
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,600
That's Mr. Ji from compliance,

215
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,240
here to audit us specifically.

216
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,880
Audit us?

217
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,199
Right.

218
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,919
Miss Wang, right?

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,719
Please come this way.

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,679
Sir, what can I assist you with?

221
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,600
This way, please.

222
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,000
Hello.

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,679
Please come this way.

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,039
So,

225
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,959
the first time

226
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,600
we met at the matchmaking site...

227
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,400
I initially thought

228
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,079
we just happened to cross paths.

229
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Surprisingly,

230
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,880
you came back specifically for me.

231
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,760
Later on,

232
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,799
I brought up the idea of marriage.

233
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:05,760
I thought you felt the same way

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,160
that we were simply

235
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,959
a good match,

236
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,640
with the excitement of

237
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,799
opening a blind box, stepping into the

238
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,199
next chapter of our relationship.

239
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,439
I can say that we're classmates,

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,039
it makes us feel at ease

241
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,160
with each other.

242
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,760
In marriage,

243
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,959
it doesn't have to revolve around love.

244
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,240
Comfort and stability

245
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,959
are also very important.

246
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,600
But in truth,

247
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,000
you had already decided

248
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:34,799
to marry me.

249
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,360
What matters is not

250
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,079
conditions, but love.

251
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,719
Here are all my documents.

252
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,959
The property deed,

253
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,839
diplomas,

254
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,160
no-criminal record,

255
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,160
credit reports,

256
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,400
and my bank statements

257
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,319
for recent years.

258
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,799
I realize this

259
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,000
might seem a bit inappropriate,

260
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,039
but it's the fastest way

261
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
I could think of

262
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,160
to help you both get to know me.

263
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,520
You know,

264
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,319
I love you.

265
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,520
Come on,

266
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
why am I crying?

267
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,679
It's been such a long time.

268
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:51,919
Mr. Ji,

269
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,719
you've always given me plenty of space,

270
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:57,400
and a sense of security.

271
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,160
You've been waiting for me

272
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,319
to fall in love with you, haven't you?

273
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,520
So it's not something

274
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,079
like a sudden reunion

275
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,120
after a long time.

276
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:15,719
You've been planning this for a long time,

277
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,319
innit?

278
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,000
Silly.

279
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,319
Of course, it's also a reunion.

280
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,120
But you know,

281
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,319
I waited too long.

282
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,079
I was so afraid

283
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,600
that I might miss you.

284
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,719
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

285
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,880
I thought

286
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,480
someone else was your dream girl.

287
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,160
You didn't even explain it to me.

288
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,199
How could you do that?

289
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:48,839
Our feelings are

290
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:49,760
getting stronger.

291
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,880
I don't wanna bring

292
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
those in the past up.

293
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:55,199
They wouldn't

294
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:55,959
affect us.

295
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,039
Besides,

296
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,199
in front of Tang Yuhui that night,

297
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,079
I also mentioned that

298
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,719
I fell in love with you

299
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,400
at first sight.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,199
But it took me so long

301
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,600
to find out about this.

302
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,840
After all these years,

303
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,360
in this relationship,

304
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:16,679
you've always taken 99 steps on your own,

305
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,080
waiting for me to take that final step.

306
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,040
You've been through a lot.

307
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,800
And you must

308
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,519
have felt

309
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,719
incredibly lonely.

310
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,999
I believe it's worth it.

311
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,040
Honestly, I've always

312
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,199
dreamed of this moment.

313
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:40,919
I think it deserves

314
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,279
a bit of ceremony.

315
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,800
But Xiaoning,

316
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,120
I truly can't wait any longer.

317
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,479
Even if I have to take 100 steps,

318
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,919
that's perfectly fine.

319
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,120
As long as you give me a sign,

320
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:26,719
just a nod,

321
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:28,320
or a smile.

322
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,400
So, Miss Tu,

323
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,479
will you marry me?

324
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,519
Yes.

325
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,560
Mr. Ji.

326
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,439
Put it on me now.

327
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,640
Thank you,

328
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,400
Mr. Ji.

329
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,880
Thank you so much

330
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,640
for

331
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,560
letting me know

332
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,439
that your love

333
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,479
for me

334
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,160
has lasted for so long.

335
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,040
Thank you.

336
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,479
I love you.

337
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,199
Mr. Ji.

338
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:01,679
I love you, too.

339
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,360
Actually,

340
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,880
I originally planned

341
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,239
to propose to you

342
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,080
during vacation.

343
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,640
But today, I just

344
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,320
couldn't hold back.

345
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,439
It must be

346
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,439
completed today.

347
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,479
I can't wait to be recognized

348
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:43,640
as your husband.

349
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:46,400
So,

350
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,640
you've been

351
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,400
carrying this ring around

352
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,040
with you everywhere?

353
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,439
Not really.

354
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:52,519
I

355
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,919
specifically hired a

356
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,919
wedding planner,

357
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:56,080
hoping to create

358
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,640
unforgettable

359
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,840
and truly ceremonial

360
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,160
proposal experience for you.

361
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,199
But this afternoon,

362
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,880
I was genuinely worried about you,

363
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,279
so I stood them up.

364
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:09,840
What's so funny?

365
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,959
What's wrong with me laughing?

366
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:12,719
I'm just so happy.

367
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm thrilled

368
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,279
that you can so confidently

369
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:15,880
choose me.

370
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,279
Hello, Mr. Yu.

371
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,919
Hey, Xiaoning,

372
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,120
the small loan

373
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,840
has been sealed.

374
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,919
Just want to let you know.

375
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,640
Thanks.

376
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,160
No problem.

377
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,279
I should be thanking you

378
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,800
for choosing Dairui.

379
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,759
If you ever need any

380
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,999
financial services in the future,

381
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
feel free to reach out to me.

382
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:35,959
Sounds good.

383
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:36,400
No problem at all.

384
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,719
By the way,

385
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,679
there's one more thing.

386
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,880
Last time,

387
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,120
you talked about

388
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,679
me and certain some guy.

389
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,439
Were you referring to Ji Yuheng?

390
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,239
That's all in the past.

391
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:46,999
Why bring it up?

392
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,959
Just tell me.

393
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,479
If you don't,

394
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,600
I won't be able to help you

395
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,640
with any loan matters.

396
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,840
Oh, no!

397
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,120
I'll say it, OK?

398
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,959
Back then, I was playing a prank on you.

399
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:58,880
Then,

400
00:21:58,999 --> 00:21:59,679
he beat me up

401
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,239
after school.

402
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,080
We can't judge a book by its cover, huh?

403
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,400
He beat you up?

404
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:07,160
Yeah.

405
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,999
He even said,

406
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,360
if I bothered you again,

407
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
or made his love

408
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,519
for you public,

409
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,120
he would report me

410
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:13,919
to the school,

411
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,160
and have them check the camera.

412
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,959
Who knows,

413
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,320
I might have even got expelled!

414
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Whoa, you were that intimidating?

415
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
You even dared to bully the school bully!

416
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:22,999
What?

417
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,800
I bullied the school bully?

418
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:26,439
No,

419
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,600
I mean,

420
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
weren't you the school bully?

421
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,239
He really got some guts

422
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,199
to bully you.

423
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,320
Why are you so interested

424
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,279
in his history?

425
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:37,840
No way!

426
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Could it be that

427
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,199
you had feelings for him?

428
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,519
She didn't back then,

429
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,600
but she does now.

430
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:45,040
In terms of business,

431
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,080
please call my wife

432
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,999
during office hours.

433
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,679
We are out.

434
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,759
What wife?

435
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,439
We're not officially married yet.

436
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,160
Let's get registered tomorrow.

437
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,120
Now come home with me.

438
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,519
Wasn't that Ji Yuheng's voice?

439
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,800
Wife?

440
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:07,959
So...

441
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,439
Hello.

442
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Here's our number.

443
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,279
Hello.

444
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:18,919
Documents, thanks.

445
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,479
Our photos are among them.

446
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,160
Are you both first-time married?

447
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,239
Yeah.

448
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,439
This is the photo you are using?

449
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,679
It's not as natural

450
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,320
as you two look now.

451
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:46,040
The marriage certificate

452
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,199
is quite important.

453
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,999
How about...

454
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,400
We take another one?

455
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,719
OK, sir and ma'am,

456
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,199
please get a bit closer.

457
00:23:59,199 --> 00:23:59,800
Closer.

458
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:00,600
Good.

459
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,919
Um...

460
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,479
too much actually.

461
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,479
It's like you're stacked together.

462
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,880
Keep more distance.

463
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:07,360
Exactly!

464
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,719
Alright!

465
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,719
Smile.

466
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:11,719
Sir.

467
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,479
Your happiness is shining through.

468
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:14,439
I totally get it.

469
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,800
But your smile is so big!

470
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,560
While taking the photo,

471
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,759
all we see are your big white teeth!

472
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,120
Tone it down a bit.

473
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,880
Just a little.

474
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,160
Right!

475
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:22,439
Ma'am.

476
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,279
You're leaning on his shoulder.

477
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,040
That's not

478
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,199
symmetrical!

479
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,479
Perfect!

480
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,239
Smile, come on!

481
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,199
This looks great!

482
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:30,880
Three!

483
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,679
Two!

484
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:32,519
One!

485
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:35,999
Not bad!

486
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,919
One more time!

487
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:37,959
Three!

488
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,880
Two!

489
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:39,759
One!

490
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,439
Mr. Ji,

491
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,400
We are officially

492
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,479
married now!

493
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,160
Let's take a photo

494
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,080
to commemorate this moment.

495
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,679
Come on!

496
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:55,040
Cool.

497
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,840
But we're still missing something.

498
00:24:59,199 --> 00:24:59,959
I'll go grab it now.

499
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,800
Just wait for me.

500
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,800
Guess who I just saw?

501
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,640
I saw Mrs. Xu's daughter

502
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,279
at the registry office!

503
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:40,959
Congratulations,

504
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:41,479
Mrs. Ji.

505
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,120
Thank you!

506
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:44,840
Here,

507
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,479
one for each of us.

508
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,160
Go!

509
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,600
Happily married!

510
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,439
Yay!

511
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,919
Nonsense!

512
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,320
They only

513
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,479
got married a year ago.

514
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,080
They're so in love.

515
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,679
Divorce? Ridiculous!

516
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:06,040
Seriously.

517
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,160
I saw them

518
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,239
walk out of the registry office

519
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,400
and go their own ways.

520
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,600
I know

521
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,479
it hurts.

522
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,360
But kids are all grown up.

523
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,840
They don't always have to tell us

524
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:16,999
everything before making choices.

525
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,199
I'm not upset.

526
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,919
I know better than

527
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:20,679
anyone how they

528
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,759
feel about each other.

529
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:22,800
You know.

530
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,840
You must have made a mistake.

531
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,320
I'm gonna check with my daughter.

532
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,239
I'll show you

533
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:26,919
their marriage certificate.

534
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:29,679
Nonsense.

535
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,560
What the hell?

536
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Where are you going?

537
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:35,999
I'm going to Xiaoning's place,

538
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:36,959
and snap a picture

539
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
of their wedding certificate.

540
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,439
That's what the evidence says.

541
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,160
C'mon,

542
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,279
no need to worry

543
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,360
about too much.

544
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,479
A fact is a fact.

545
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:46,439
But I must

546
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,759
put a stop

547
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,279
to this.

548
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:48,800
I can't just ignore it.

549
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,160
Dad.

550
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:49,800
Mom, dad.

551
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,400
We're home.

552
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,719
Any good eats?

553
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,679
Where...

554
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,479
have you...

555
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,320
See,

556
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,400
they're all lovey-dovey.

557
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,400
I knew she was full of it.

558
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,840
Check out these beautiful flowers.

559
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,959
Haven't gotten any in forever.

560
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,959
My kids are so thoughtful.

561
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,880
Glad you like them.

562
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,279
Put them in a pretty pot.

563
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,560
I'll buy you more.

564
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,040
Make them look nice.

565
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,199
Have a seat.

566
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,080
Gotta take a break.

567
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,640
What a busy morning!

568
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,959
I'm telling you,

569
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:25,640
I was pissed off!

570
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,360
You don't know

571
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,679
what a ridiculous thing happened today.

572
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:29,919
Ms. Zhao from

573
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,519
the next

574
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:31,519
building called,

575
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,800
saying she saw

576
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,880
you two at the registry office

577
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,759
getting a divorce.

578
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,560
Unbelievable.

579
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,560
Definitely!

580
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,759
It's crazy, isn't it?

581
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,439
I told her

582
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,640
straight up

583
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,040
that it's impossible,

584
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,679
'cause you're

585
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,519
so in love.

586
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,719
Later, show me that cert,

587
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:52,519
I gotta take a photo

588
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:53,439
and show her

589
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,679
how wrong she is.

590
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:05,800
Wait...

591
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:07,840
Why

592
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,759
the silence?

593
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:10,719
Mom.

594
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,040
We

595
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,199
did go there.

596
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,279
What for?

597
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:21,759
Dad, mom.

598
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,279
There's something

599
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,439
we need to

600
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,239
be honest about with you.

601
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,640
Dad.

602
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,160
Mom.

603
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,519
About the marriage cert,

604
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,080
I have to

605
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,279
apologize for not

606
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:49,360
telling you right away.

607
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,959
That's totally

608
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:50,880
my bad.

609
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,519
But you know,

610
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,519
many have happened since then,

611
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:54,959
I just couldn't find

612
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,199
the right moment.

613
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,840
But over this past year,

614
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,519
we've really got to know

615
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,880
each other better, and we feel

616
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,400
more committed now.

617
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,160
Right.

618
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,679
It was

619
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,320
a false alarm.

620
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,840
But it ended well.

621
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:17,719
Just

622
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,320
forget about it.

623
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,519
It ended well.

624
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,959
I'm bummed.

625
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,120
My girl's all grown up

626
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,040
and

627
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,279
keeping secrets.

628
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,560
First, secretly getting married,

629
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:35,679
next,

630
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,160
keeping a granddaughter

631
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,600
from me till

632
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,840
she's 18.

633
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,640
Come on.

634
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,759
I'm so

635
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,160
disappointed.

636
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,600
Mom, you're going overboard.

637
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,719
Wait,

638
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,239
is this about us

639
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,279
embarrassing you in front of Ms. Zhao?

640
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:54,719
How about

641
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,759
I take a photo

642
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,560
and fake the date

643
00:29:58,719 --> 00:29:59,759
to last year?

644
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,640
We're married for real,

645
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
so it's not a lie, huh?

646
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,239
It's not about saving face,

647
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,800
but about trust.

648
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,400
My

649
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,880
daughter really

650
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,999
broke my heart.

651
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,239
Mom, no...

652
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:17,560
What...

653
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,279
You're tearing up.

654
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,160
What can I do to make you

655
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:25,679
feel better?

656
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,239
Come on.

657
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,999
You know your mom.

658
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
She's a party

659
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,840
animal.

660
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,040
Think,

661
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,759
what's the reason

662
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,400
to throw a party?

663
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,679
You're really married,

664
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:41,679
aren't you?

665
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,279
Dad.

666
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:44,999
I see.

667
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,560
Mom.

668
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,160
Alright.

669
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,040
I'll get

670
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,080
the wedding plans

671
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:50,279
rolling soon.

672
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,959
No worries.

673
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,439
You're thoughtful.

674
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:57,759
So, when?

675
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,239
Mom.

676
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,279
Are you happy now?

677
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:02,800
Okay.

678
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:03,320
We'll

679
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,800
do the wedding when we're

680
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,479
back from vacation.

681
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,239
That sounds good to you?

682
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,400
Yes.

683
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:09,519
That's settled then.

684
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:10,640
Done.

685
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,360
Go cook.

686
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,400
Let me help you.

687
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,840
My phone...

688
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:23,279
Check this out.

689
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,880
It's the venue

690
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:24,640
and

691
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,239
decor from my

692
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,560
co-worker's son's wedding.

693
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:28,600
See?

694
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,080
So pretty.

695
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,279
The coolest thing

696
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,239
about this hotel?

697
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,840
A bridge in the hall

698
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,719
that you can walk on.

699
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:37,560
Imagine

700
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,400
you two,

701
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,120
the bride and groom,

702
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,439
walking over it,

703
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,439
right over everyone's

704
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,360
heads.

705
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,400
A real-life "Magpie Bridge Meeting".

706
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:47,160
Mom.

707
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,999
Walking over people's

708
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:49,600
heads is

709
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,560
kinda weird,

710
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,640
and the "meeting" thing

711
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:53,560
means we'll

712
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,800
only meet once a year.

713
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
I was talking nonsense.

714
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,640
Forget it.

715
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,279
But anyway,

716
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:00,080
that bridge is gorgeous.

717
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,999
You gotta look amazing,

718
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:01,959
okay?

719
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,439
The only

720
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,880
official partner.

721
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,840
My love for you is forever,

722
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,239
unconditional,

723
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,519
and never fades.

724
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:27,759
Morning.

725
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,320
Tu.

726
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,560
Happy Marriage!

727
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:34,560
Thanks.

728
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,719
Thank you all.

729
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:37,320
Congrats!

730
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,040
That's amazing!

731
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:38,519
Xiaoning,

732
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:39,479
when will you hold your wedding?

733
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,759
We've got our gift money ready.

734
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,519
Xu Li.

735
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,160
Gift money?

736
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,199
Don't mention it.

737
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,479
If Fanggang was around,

738
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,239
he would cast aspersions

739
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,120
on you.

740
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,959
Gift money...

741
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,800
How about this?

742
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,239
Don't worry about giving it yet.

743
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,080
I'll send the

744
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,160
payment code to the group,

745
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:53,999
and nobody should skip out on this.

746
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,199
Sure.

747
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,080
Now,

748
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,120
once again.

749
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,880
Happy Marriage!

750
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:13,800
What's up with Mr Fu?

751
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,880
He hit me up and said

752
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,560
he's not down to

753
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,320
collaborate with us.

754
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,239
Close the door.

755
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:19,800
Sit.

756
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:29,600
Okay, I got it.

757
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,759
Thank you.

758
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:34,640
Mr Fu is spreading the news

759
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:35,999
that he's

760
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:36,919
on the hunt for a new partner.

761
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,679
Sorry, Jing.

762
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,439
It's my fault.

763
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,160
Don't say that.

764
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,199
Neither you nor Mr Ji

765
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:44,600
did anything wrong.

766
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:45,479
You know.

767
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,640
If I were there,

768
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,880
even pregnant,

769
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,040
I'd give him

770
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,519
a good slap

771
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,400
or two.

772
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,759
Alright,

773
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:53,880
calm down.

774
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,519
But it's true

775
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,840
that I lost

776
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,279
a big client.

777
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,120
If we landed it,

778
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,080
you'd be a department

779
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,919
head by now.

780
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,479
Who knew it would fail...

781
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm hormonal,

782
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:08,040
don't get me angry.

783
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,560
My promotion is

784
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,560
my business.

785
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Don't sacrifice

786
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,279
your everything for it,

787
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:13,759
okay?

788
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,759
I don't need you to

789
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,000
sell yourself for me.

790
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,239
If you do,

791
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,560
I won't let you off easily.

792
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,879
And as for Mr Fu,

793
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,279
he's shady,

794
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,879
using tricks to get deals.

795
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,960
Who wants

796
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:27,080
a client like him?

797
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:28,120
Not me anyway.

798
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:29,960
Anyone in the office

799
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,759
talks crap about you?

800
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,879
You know,

801
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:34,640
I'm not like Mr. Ji,

802
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,960
I won't wait for

803
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,199
the rumors

804
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,199
to die down.

805
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,600
Anyone who says a bad word

806
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,679
about you,

807
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,440
I'll rip their mouth apart.

808
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,399
Babe.

809
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,199
Mom's talking to Xiaoning.

810
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,799
Mom's usually very gentle.

811
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,719
Oh?

812
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,879
Happy?

813
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,319
It takes a pregnant

814
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:54,879
leader like me

815
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,759
to cheer you up.

816
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,679
Figured it out?

817
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,399
Ms Rao.

818
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
Your words

819
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,480
really hit

820
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,279
the spot.

821
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,000
From now on,

822
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,199
I'm all in for you.

823
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:08,879
Listen,

824
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:11,520
after this whole mess is over,

825
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,120
I'm giving you some time

826
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,239
off for your honeymoon.

827
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:16,759
Go have fun with Mr. Ji.

828
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,879
Thank you.

829
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:21,160
Damn it!

830
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,560
Fu Yijun is a total

831
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,600
scumbag!

832
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,160
You did the right thing.

833
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,640
If I had been present there,

834
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,719
I would have torn him apart!

835
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,399
Chill out.

836
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:34,759
The

837
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:36,040
Youpin thing

838
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,000
is over.

839
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,879
We gotta focus on

840
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,759
finding new

841
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:40,920
clients.

842
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,319
Sit.

843
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:55,799
It's a pity.

844
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:57,839
You bet your next six months'

845
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,640
performance

846
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,120
for that sweet rate.

847
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:02,279
In our industry,

848
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,440
we usually negotiate for

849
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,319
rate discounts

850
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:05,160
during pricing

851
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,480
after establishing

852
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,120
a business relationship.

853
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,319
You earned that rate

854
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,120
for that bastard.

855
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,279
But he's backed out.

856
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
It's a waste.

857
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,679
Actually, I don't

858
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
think it's a waste at all.

859
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,679
In this long process,

860
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,600
we all did

861
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,679
our best,

862
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,440
and we found out

863
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,120
what kind of person

864
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,279
he really is.

865
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,520
You're right.

866
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:39,440
He

867
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:40,920
ain't worth our time.

868
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:42,839
And

869
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,960
with our experience,

870
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,839
finding new

871
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:46,199
clients is a breeze.

872
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,080
Since we work together,

873
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,160
clients will be

874
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,199
lining up.

875
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Losing Mr. Fu means

876
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:52,960
we'll get Mr. Li, Mr. Wang, Mr. Liu,

877
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,719
and many more.

878
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:55,440
Stop talking nonsense.

879
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,960
How do we move

880
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,560
forward?

881
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,839
Which client should we start with?

882
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:01,920
It's a long road,

883
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,279
but I've picked out a few.

884
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:04,960
Check it out.

885
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:07,879
Ms Zhu.

886
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:09,000
I've been practicing yoga

887
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,560
at your studio for two months.

888
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,520
I think you're doing

889
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,640
a fantastic job.

890
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,239
I invited you here today

891
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,719
just to tell you that

892
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,759
if you're looking to

893
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:18,000
expand your studio,

894
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,199
our bank has

895
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,239
many good

896
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,399
loan options for

897
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:22,719
small businesses like yours.

898
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:23,679
Good.

899
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,560
I've been

900
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,480
thinking about it.

901
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,679
Here's the proposal.

902
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,520
Hello.

903
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,160
Mr Chen.

904
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,319
Hello.

905
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,520
I'm Zhao Fanggang

906
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,960
from the Dairui Ji'an Branch.

907
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:33,080
Nice to meet you.

908
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,799
You don't have to

909
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,040
worry about the

910
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,080
timing and security.

911
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,799
Once you

912
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,759
open a corporate

913
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:40,960
account at our bank,

914
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,000
we'll assign

915
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
a manager to

916
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,799
help with your

917
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:44,520
loans

918
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
and deposits.

919
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,600
Hello, Mr Yu.

920
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,679
Okay.

921
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,080
Yu Hui.

922
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,520
Do you know anyone

923
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,080
who needs

924
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,560
banking

925
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,319
services?

926
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,160
Refer

927
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,239
them to me, would you?

928
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:16,199
Weiyi.

929
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:17,000
Let's hit the

930
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,080
new Bar in the Sky tonight.

931
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:18,600
Okay?

932
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,679
Drinking's boring.

933
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,879
Time to burn some

934
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:22,560
rubber.

935
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,560
You haven't been out in ages.

936
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Spend your money on excitement!

937
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,920
Nah.

938
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,600
Gotta work.

939
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,560
Just a receptionist gig.

940
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,279
Your gas costs

941
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,560
more than that OT.

942
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,440
Let's meet up.

943
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,520
I'll send you

944
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,560
the time and place later.

945
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,000
How have you been?

946
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:47,480
Same old.

947
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,520
And you?

948
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,359
Same old.

949
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,440
We really haven't been

950
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:57,920
here for a while.

951
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:00,239
Yeah.

952
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,480
Those first couple years,

953
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,600
we'd come back here

954
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,279
for games and food.

955
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:12,239
We

956
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,920
met here for the first time.

957
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,719
And you

958
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,000
taught me how to do a layup.

959
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:21,480
I tried my best,

960
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:22,799
you didn't.

961
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:26,399
Took me

962
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:28,719
three tries to pass.

963
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,799
Then,

964
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:34,160
you and Xiaoning

965
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,239
always dragged me out

966
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,440
at night.

967
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:38,560
And I couldn't say no.

968
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,160
You're like our

969
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:44,040
bodyguard

970
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,839
at night.

971
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:47,759
Yeah.

972
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,319
Ever since then,

973
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,879
I've had a thing for you.

974
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,319
What's Yu Hui up to?

975
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,120
He's gonna

976
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:29,799
get back

977
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,440
at the girl who

978
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,359
beaned him with a ball.

979
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,279
She's in trouble.

980
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,000
Why'd she

981
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,839
mess with him?

982
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,000
I said,

983
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,199
be careful after school,

984
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
this is what you get.

985
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,239
You did this, huh?

986
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah, so what?

987
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,839
Wanna beg for mercy?

988
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,160
Psycho.

989
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:19,960
What?

990
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:21,160
You did it

991
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:23,640
and want me to beg you?

992
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,679
You never learn.

993
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,120
You're a loser.

994
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,000
What?

995
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,480
You...

996
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:36,319
Who...

997
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,920
Don't mess with a girl.

998
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,000
Wanna be the hero?

999
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,640
Fine.

1000
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,359
We'll see

1001
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:49,319
if you're a hero or a coward.

1002
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,319
You're gonna

1003
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,359
kill me over a chick?

1004
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,520
You into her?

1005
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,920
Yu Hui, back off

1006
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
if you

1007
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,920
wanna graduate.

1008
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,759
Dropping out,

1009
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:09,719
know what that is?

1010
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:11,000
Your future's

1011
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,120
not your concern, huh?

1012
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,600
But remember

1013
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,759
how your parents begged

1014
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:16,480
the dean to keep you in school?

1015
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,199
Need a refresher?

1016
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,879
Threatening me

1017
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:21,799
over this chick?

1018
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,199
Bold move.

1019
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:26,319
If next time,

1020
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,399
we'll see.
