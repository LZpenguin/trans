00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,120
You Are My Secret EP17

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Hey there!

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,720
Happy New Year!

5
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,879
Are you still in the dorm?

6
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
Why didn't you tell me?

7
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
I'm also home alone.

8
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,039
Actually, I didn't go back home

9
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,800
'cause I'm busy studying.

10
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,679
Aren't you with your family?

11
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,120
My dad is on a business trip.

12
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,120
My mom is on vacation abroad.

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,680
They actually

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
wanted me to join

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,879
those distant relatives.

16
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,280
I'm definitely not going!

17
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,919
Wait for me.

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,079
I'm coming for you.

19
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,639
OK.

20
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,039
So this is what the beach looks like

21
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,280
during the New Year.

22
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,280
What you up to?

23
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:47,879
I wanna...

24
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,960
It's cold, don't.

25
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,520
But I wanna get closer to the sea,

26
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,240
and splash around a bit.

27
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,720
Come on.

28
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,199
There!

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,919
Is it cold?

30
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,280
Your ears feel cool.

31
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:28,079
You know what?

32
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,400
When I was a kid,

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,479
watching Korean shows,

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,039
I always saw

35
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,479
the male lead carrying the female lead

36
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,840
walking along the beach.

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,520
These are all typical tropes.

38
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,560
I never thought that one day

39
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,879
I could enjoy something like this.

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
I remember we

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,680
watched a show before.

42
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,799
What was it called again?

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,000
Autumn in My...

44
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,400
Stop it!

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,319
Are you so eager to find another girl?

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,520
That show was a tragedy, right?

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,879
But I believe

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,000
we'll definitely not end up like that.

49
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,479
You will be good,

50
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,720
and I will be good too.

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,720
We will always

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,919
be together.

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,520
Never apart.

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,479
This is the first time I've seen

55
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,359
an empty beach.

56
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,240
Everyone's home celebrating the New Year.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,799
Tell me,

58
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,160
when will the two of us

59
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,960
have our own home?

60
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:27,680
Qi Yu,

61
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,799
if you're proposing to me

62
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,599
this way,

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,359
I won't agree.

64
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,239
This is not a proposal.

65
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,999
If I were to propose,

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,799
I would make it the most unique.

67
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:40,439
Do you wanna

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,559
go to my home for the New Year next year?

69
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,200
Careful.

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Sorry.

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,080
It's OK.

72
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,679
It's my parents.

73
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,479
Would you like to talk to them?

74
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,999
I'm good.

75
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:05,919
You

76
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,200
should say hi to them for me.

77
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,799
Today is New Year's Eve.

78
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,679
You three should

79
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,559
have a talk.

80
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,479
I don't wanna be a third wheel.

81
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll go have some fun on my own.

82
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:23,559
Qi Yu,

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,280
you've really grown up now, huh?

84
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,760
You don't wanna take

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,200
the job we got for you at home,

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,840
but you have to stay so far away.

87
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,439
You're not coming back for the New Year.

88
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:34,999
Everyone will ask

89
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:35,840
where you are

90
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,200
when they see us.

91
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,400
Have you been drinking again?

92
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:41,919
No.

93
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:43,080
Son,

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,359
no worries.

95
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,919
Your dad is just worried about you,

96
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,880
afraid you're not doing well alone.

97
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,960
What did you have for dinner?

98
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,400
Aren't you with your friends?

99
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,760
Mom,

100
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,280
I'm doing just fine here.

101
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:56,840
And I will...

102
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,679
Your work there

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,520
is unstable,

104
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,039
and you're not making much money.

105
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,239
Your life feels like a game.

106
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,520
What's the point of getting a girlfriend?

107
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:07,960
I don't think

108
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,840
you two can make it.

109
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:10,999
Hey, it's a good day today!

110
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,439
What the hack were you talking about?

111
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:12,760
Dad.

112
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,479
I...

113
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,280
Son,

114
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,439
forget it.

115
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,280
It's the New Year's Eve.

116
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
Have something nice to eat.

117
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,999
Call us when you have time.

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,599
Sure.

119
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,200
Mom, dad,

120
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,320
happy New Year!

121
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,039
Happy New Year!

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,559
Say something, you.

123
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:26,919
Alright,

124
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,400
let's hang up.

125
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,400
Happy New Year.

126
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,400
Come here!

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,119
Hurry!

128
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:44,679
Sit here.

129
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,799
Let's see who can swing higher!

130
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,960
Who just shouted for me

131
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,080
to pay for your cooking skills?

132
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,919
I thought you could whip up

133
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,039
a couple of nice dishes for me.

134
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,559
Now tell me what this is.

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,280
Food delivery?

136
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,160
If I'd like these, what do I need you for?

137
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,520
You don't even

138
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,160
cook at home.

139
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,919
Your seasonings must be lacking.

140
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,999
I can't make it without ingredients.

141
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,439
Alright.

142
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,439
Delivery is fine.

143
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
What are you up to now?

144
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:19,320
Plating the food?

145
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,960
Is that necessary for only two of us?

146
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,840
And we'll still have to

147
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,960
wash these plates later.

148
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,559
What I want is this vibe of abundance,

149
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,760
a prosperous life.

150
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,679
Otherwise, why call it New Year?

151
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:30,960
Prosperity?

152
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,400
Don't you know if I'm prosperous or not?

153
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,039
I can kiss New Year gifts goodbye again.

154
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,559
How beautiful!

155
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:51,400
Yeah,

156
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,880
you're really rolling in it now.

157
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,880
With that cabinet full of bags,

158
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,119
selling one would be

159
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,880
enough for your debts.

160
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,599
Selling?

161
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,840
Zhao Fanggang, I'll kill you!

162
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,119
Hurry,

163
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:03,799
repeat after me,

164
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,160
pah, pah, pah!

165
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,720
It was innocent talk.

166
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,479
Are you out of your mind?

167
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,320
You're over thirty!

168
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,119
It was innocent talk.

169
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,880
Idiot!

170
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,359
Pah, pah, pah!

171
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,960
It was innocent talk.

172
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:10,599
Pah, pah, pah!

173
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,080
It was innocent talk.

174
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,559
Fine, fine!

175
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:11,919
I'll say it, I'll say it!

176
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,359
I was wrong!

177
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:15,119
It was innocent talk.

178
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,799
Alright?

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,520
Pah, pah, pah.

180
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,760
There you go.

181
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,520
OK.

182
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,919
It's the New Year.

183
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,160
It's all about having a good time.

184
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,919
We common folks,

185
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:27,799
looking forward to the year ahead.

186
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,840
No matter how much we make this year,

187
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,919
we have to stay cheerful.

188
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,799
That way, every day in the coming year

189
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:33,720
will be safe

190
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,640
and sound.

191
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,239
This skit

192
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,520
is really entertaining!

193
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,959
Here we go.

194
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,919
Why are you looking at me like that?

195
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,799
Nothing.

196
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,520
It's just that

197
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
the way you nagged

198
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,280
reminded me of my dad.

199
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,480
Besides these,

200
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,760
I have a signature dish.

201
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Yellow bean sprouts.

202
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,240
Signature dish, yellow bean sprouts?

203
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,520
Don't underestimate these sprouts.

204
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,319
In my hometown, we eat these

205
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:20,000
for New Year

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,760
and birthdays.

207
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,480
They symbolize good fortune,

208
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,439
also known as "fortune vegetables".

209
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:25,559
Just wait,

210
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,039
you're in for a treat.

211
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:33,880
Alright.

212
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,719
Leave it to me.

213
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,120
I'm afraid you'll blow up my kitchen.

214
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,400
Retard.

215
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:42,280
Dumplings are ready!

216
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,719
Here.

217
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,559
Put them here.

218
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:43,959
I'm coming.

219
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:44,559
Here, here.

220
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,079
Put them here.

221
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,559
Careful.

222
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:45,880
Put them here.

223
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,839
Yuheng's cooking skills

224
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,880
are on par with mine.

225
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,319
Not just his cooking,

226
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:51,160
but also his mannerisms.

227
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,199
He's starting to resemble the younger me.

228
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,039
Thanks.

229
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,839
Oh, come on.

230
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:56,959
Not to mention anything else,

231
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,520
just based on looks alone,

232
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,719
you're nowhere near

233
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,839
as good-looking

234
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,039
as Yuheng is now.

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,280
Your mom pursued me back then.

236
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
She said I looked

237
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,520
like that big star,

238
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,199
Kris Phillips.

239
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,199
Right?

240
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,240
Yeah.

241
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,240
He is Kris Phillips.

242
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,199
You're Kris Fat.

243
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
Come on, dig in.

244
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,400
Time to eat.

245
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,719
Try the dumplings!

246
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on, have some of these.

247
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,000
OK, OK.

248
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,439
The shrimps are so good.

249
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,400
It's the coin.

250
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:39,520
You found the coin in it!

251
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:40,880
This means

252
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,079
you're gonna have good luck!

253
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:43,679
May you

254
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,880
abundant fortune!

255
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,280
We all hope to

256
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
share in your good fortune.

257
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:48,839
Absolutely.

258
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,679
That's wonderful!

259
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,240
Come on.

260
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,839
Let's make a toast.

261
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,120
In the new year...

262
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,160
may us have great fortune!

263
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,079
Thanks.

264
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,039
Everything goes well.

265
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,600
Great fortune!

266
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,719
Thank you, Xiaoning.

267
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:22,439
You've brought so much

268
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,919
warmth to my life.

269
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,120
Ji Yuheng,

270
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,360
thanks to you,

271
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,719
my life

272
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,039
feels so complete.

273
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,039
Happy New Year!

274
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:04,480
What's up?

275
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,079
I'm taking over your spot.

276
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:11,919
Your dumplings are good.

277
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,719
You're trying to take my spot?

278
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,280
Happy New Year,

279
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,000
Mr. Ji.

280
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,240
Happy New Year.

281
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,319
I hope that in the future,

282
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,319
we can celebrate

283
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,559
every new year together.

284
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,120
Absolutely.

285
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,000
Then it's settled!

286
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,160
Sure.

287
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,360
Looks great.

288
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,079
I'll have one as well.

289
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,319
Seeing how affectionate they are,

290
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,919
I think we'll be

291
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,520
grandparents soon.

292
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,760
You mentioned before

293
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,000
that they're living separately.

294
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,760
I was a bit worried back then.

295
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,839
But now it seems

296
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,679
that worry

297
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
was unnecessary.

298
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,600
Exactly.

299
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,480
Now,

300
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,480
this is how newlyweds

301
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,199
should be, right?

302
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,199
Yuheng

303
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:27,679
has had feelings for Xiaoning for years.

304
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,959
Now they're finally together.

305
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,520
How did you know that

306
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,719
Yuheng has had a crush

307
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,280
on Xiaoning for years?

308
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,839
Before they got married,

309
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,000
Yuheng came to see

310
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,240
me and my husband once,

311
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,360
telling us

312
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
that he's serious

313
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,120
about Xiaoning.

314
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,559
You didn't know?

315
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:01,600
Boys

316
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,959
don't share their thoughts with moms.

317
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,919
That's perfectly normal.

318
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
I don't blame him.

319
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,039
It was my fault.

320
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:13,959
This is my first time

321
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:16,280
celebrating the festival away from home.

322
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,039
In the past,

323
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,719
I always celebrated it with my parents.

324
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,880
This year, it's with both our families.

325
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,199
It's really wonderful.

326
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,480
So, Ms Tu, how do you

327
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,520
feel about it?

328
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,600
Even though we haven't registered yet,

329
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
to be honest,

330
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,679
this is the marriage life

331
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,559
I've always wanted.

332
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,959
Mom has been discharged.

333
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,120
Your financial burden

334
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,240
has lightened a lot.

335
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,120
If I can secure

336
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,039
this shipyard contract,

337
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,679
I should be able to be made permanent.

338
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,160
Then my salary will increase.

339
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,280
We can save money together

340
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
and take our parents on a trip.

341
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,760
Sure.

342
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,919
And you mentioned before

343
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,679
that you wanted to take me and mom

344
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,280
to visit dad's grave.

345
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:12,799
When are we going?

346
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,079
After his father passed away,

347
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,520
I couldn't move on for a long time.

348
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,120
I didn't show him

349
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,880
much care.

350
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,000
He went abroad for years,

351
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,679
and we grew even more distant.

352
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,480
I feel like a

353
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,400
failure as a mother.

354
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,760
If he had something on his mind,

355
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,240
he's even less likely to share it.

356
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,400
Don't think that way.

357
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,799
We've got a huge family.

358
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,799
How wonderful!

359
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,799
So lively!

360
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,319
We can talk about anything.

361
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:50,839
Right?

362
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,679
It's all good.

363
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,000
Dad's grave is

364
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:09,039
up in the mountains.

365
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
This year, the festival came late.

366
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:13,039
By the time we go back,

367
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,280
those trees

368
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,400
might

369
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,600
have started to bud.

370
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,439
Then we'll see

371
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:19,400
the mountains full of

372
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,319
spring scenery.

373
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,319
Yuheng, Xiaoning.

374
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,079
Mom.

375
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,319
I'm not interrupting you, am I?

376
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,480
No, not at all.

377
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,799
Xiaoning,

378
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,719
I bought

379
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,719
these rings

380
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,760
when Yuheng

381
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,559
was abroad.

382
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,360
Because I thought

383
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,439
that one day,

384
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,919
if he found a girl he liked,

385
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,919
I could give them to you as wedding gifts.

386
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,919
I mentioned them to you before

387
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,280
that they were in my drawer.

388
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,039
But you've never taken them.

389
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,799
I didn't know the

390
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,199
style you like.

391
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
You can wear it for now.

392
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,520
When it's time for your wedding,

393
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,520
Yuheng can

394
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,880
buy you a nice diamond ring.

395
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,319
It's

396
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,160
really beautiful.

397
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,000
I like it.

398
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,479
Try it on.

399
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:29,120
OK.

400
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,040
It looks great.

401
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,400
Thank you, mom.

402
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,439
Thank you, mom.

403
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
All this time,

404
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,759
I've felt like a pretty inadequate mother.

405
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,999
Now that I see you get along,

406
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,040
I really have no regrets.

407
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,679
What regrets, mom?

408
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,999
Don't say such things during the New Year.

409
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,519
Mom,

410
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,719
I don't really trust his taste.

411
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,160
Later,

412
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,999
I'll need you help choosing the ring.

413
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:39,400
OK.

414
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,800
OK.

415
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,120
Mom,

416
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,439
you'll definitely be healthy.

417
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,519
What's on your mind?

418
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:00,719
Nothing.

419
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,999
Are you thinking that

420
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,080
once you put on the ring,

421
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,519
marriage isn't far off?

422
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,880
Dream on!

423
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:18,239
I was just trying to make mom happy.

424
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,400
Otherwise,

425
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,479
I wouldn't have let you

426
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,840
put the ring on.

427
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,040
I've never agreed to marry you.

428
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:28,439
I know.

429
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:35,400
I really like this ring.

430
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,080
Once we get our marriage registered,

431
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,600
we could wear rings.

432
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,479
And I won't change it.

433
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,719
I'll just wear this one, OK?

434
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,120
We need diamond rings as well.

435
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:48,080
Let's just stick with these.

436
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,560
Hey,

437
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,040
if you're not asleep, come play cards!

438
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,080
Sure!

439
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:55,959
I can't sleep either.

440
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,999
Can you help me check

441
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,199
if the mark is still there?

442
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,160
It's gone.

443
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,360
I saw it this morning.

444
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,439
It was still there then.

445
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,439
Now it's gone?

446
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,400
Check for me.

447
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:21,279
What's up?

448
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:22,719
You're blushing.

449
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,560
It's been over half an hour

450
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,719
since you finished your drinks.

451
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,479
The alcohol is just kicking in now?

452
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,239
Do you think that with two moms around,

453
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,880
I can't do anything about you?

454
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,199
Don't you mess around!

455
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,959
They can't hear us from here.

456
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,600
It's 3:00 a.m.

457
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:55,959
Rao Jing!

458
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,759
Are you asleep?

459
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:05,880
You...

460
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,560
You just fell asleep?

461
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,279
Alright, I'm leaving!

462
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,560
It's not my house.

463
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,759
No matter how messy it is,

464
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,840
it's not my concern.

465
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,840
She's loaded; she can hire a cleaner.

466
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,959
I'm not going to work for free.

467
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,160
It's just not worth it.

468
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,800
Why is it getting colder?

469
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,759
Did I get wasted again?

470
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,519
I didn't even take off my robe.

471
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,999
I'm so thirsty.

472
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,120
Why are you still here?

473
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,400
Well,

474
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
I was planning to leave,

475
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,959
but I saw your place was a mess,

476
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:21,919
so I tidied up.

477
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,959
My place

478
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,640
is messy?

479
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,479
Didn't I say

480
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,719
I would clean it myself?

481
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,679
I told you,

482
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:39,759
I'll do it myself.

483
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,239
Here.

484
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,120
Let go.

485
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,160
Hey,

486
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,719
you were just cleaning.

487
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:52,840
How come

488
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,199
you're blushing?

489
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,239
You're red all the way to your ears.

490
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,040
Am I?

491
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,199
It's the first day of the New Year.

492
00:23:59,199 --> 00:23:59,999
I'm full of good fortune.

493
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,120
Do you know how long

494
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,800
I've been cleaning your place?

495
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:05,400
How long?

496
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,040
All night?

497
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,120
You're not going home on New Year's day.

498
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,479
Instead,

499
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,759
you are cleaning my house.

500
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,600
Do you

501
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,040
really have a crush on me?

502
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:39,519
If that's your New Year's wish,

503
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,479
I can almost help you make it happen.

504
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,160
My wish is to date

505
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,959
a few more cute guys.

506
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:46,360
You?

507
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,400
You're too old for me.

508
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,560
What a coincidence!

509
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,519
My wish is

510
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,600
to date

511
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,080
a few more cute girls.

512
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:54,919
You?

513
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,679
You're not that young anymore.

514
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:57,679
So there's nothing

515
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:58,840
more to discuss?

516
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,080
There is.

517
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:01,600
If you could

518
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,679
confess to me in tears,

519
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,679
maybe

520
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,719
you still have a shot with me.

521
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,360
The only thing that makes me cry

522
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,239
is a eulogy.

523
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,519
Whoa!

524
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,320
I'm not walking you out.

525
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,239
So long.

526
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:25,719
Don't dump trash on the first day

527
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:27,320
of the New Year.

528
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,999
It will bring bad luck.

529
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,279
Where are my shoes?

530
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:51,759
I understood.

531
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,320
I will make sure to double-check

532
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,519
this situation you mentioned.

533
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,439
It's not a small matter after all.

534
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,360
So I came to tell you

535
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,400
as soon as I heard about it.

536
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,439
And

537
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:04,080
regarding my project?

538
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,640
This company's

539
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,560
qualifications are quite good.

540
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,279
I'll report to

541
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:08,999
the higher-ups first.

542
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,120
If everything checks out,

543
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
we can proceed with the loan application.

544
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,279
Yuhui, you've passed

545
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,439
the probationary period.

546
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,080
Both your work performance

547
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,320
and evaluations

548
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,919
are satisfactory.

549
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,160
You will officially become

550
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,999
the account manager

551
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,800
in Section One

552
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:22,800
once all the HR formalities

553
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,479
are completed.

554
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:24,560
Congratulations in advance.

555
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,040
Thank you.

556
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:27,759
Get to work now.

557
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,479
Okay.

558
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,999
I'm almost done with the preparation.

559
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:39,479
How did it go?

560
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:41,800
Mr. Ji thinks it's not bad.

561
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,560
It's being reviewed.

562
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,959
Yuhui,

563
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:45,800
impressive!

564
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,560
You just lost one client,

565
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,439
and another one came along.

566
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:49,239
This quickly as well!

567
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,320
Not only quickly,

568
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,279
better quality too, this one is worth two.

569
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,040
Do you know

570
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,600
who's her next client?

571
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,479
The Chunling Group!

572
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,360
Actually

573
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,320
there were several banks

574
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,560
had their eyes on this client.

575
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:09,759
So I left Xihai

576
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,560
right away

577
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,239
before New Year.

578
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,519
And even had my dad

579
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:13,600
pull some strings.

580
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:15,999
This has even disrupted my vacation.

581
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:16,999
But it's all good,

582
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,880
the results are good.

583
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,600
What a pity!

584
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,679
Thank you for your hard work.

585
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,360
Your dad pulled some strings?

586
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,719
Not bad.

587
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,239
Using every resource

588
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,239
you have,

589
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,040
I like this way of getting

590
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:29,959
things done.

591
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,239
Xiaoning,

592
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,719
you haven't submitted Mr. Yang's

593
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:37,919
loan application yet, have you?

594
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:39,560
Mr. Ji is in a good mood now,

595
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:40,560
you should keep it up!

596
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,320
I know.

597
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,360
Keep it up!

598
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,439
Thanks, Jing.

599
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:50,239
Yes,

600
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm coming over to you now.

601
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,199
Please look into the thing

602
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:53,959
I just told you about.

603
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,160
It's Yang with the 'y',

604
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,800
remember.

605
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:58,800
Okay,

606
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,919
see you later.

607
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,400
Wait!

608
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,519
What a coincidence.

609
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,080
Mr. Ji.

610
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,959
You're getting bolder.

611
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:26,439
We have a camera here.

612
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,120
No worries.

613
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,560
This is the blind spot,

614
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,519
they can't see.

615
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,600
Are you going out?

616
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,320
I have to check out something.

617
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:40,360
And you?

618
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,479
I'm going to lunch.

619
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,160
Since you're free now,

620
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:45,959
I have something to show you.

621
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,600
The loan application

622
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:49,679
of the Shipyard?

623
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,519
Yes.

624
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,479
This is some

625
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,759
information on their company,

626
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:53,999
including operational conditions

627
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,959
and the financial reports.

628
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,800
I hope Mr. Ji

629
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,880
will approve it soon,

630
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,160
considering my diligence

631
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,120
and hard work.

632
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
This is my first project.

633
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,279
Don't worry,

634
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,560
I will give it my all

635
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,360
and do a good job.

636
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:12,959
Well,

637
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,199
have the background checks

638
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:15,999
been confirmed?

639
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,199
The company's

640
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,439
and the owner's credit history,

641
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,120
and all examinations

642
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,040
have been done.

643
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,719
Don't be afraid of all the trouble.

644
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,479
Check them again.

645
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,919
Okay, Mr. Ji.

646
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,199
Goodbye.

647
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,800
Bye.

648
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,759
Do you know that death comes

649
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,439
from ease and pleasure?

650
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,919
I've always emphasized

651
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,719
the importance of crisis awareness!

652
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,120
Did you just ignore it?

653
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,160
What is this Mr. Xing doing

654
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,040
in the middle of the day?

655
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:53,400
If today

656
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:55,080
they can

657
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
outpace us

658
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,840
in client expansion,

659
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:57,959
tomorrow, they'll be able to

660
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,400
crush us in performance review!

661
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,640
Being stepped on

662
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,400
by Ji Yuheng,

663
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,759
even if you're not ashamed,

664
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,919
I'm embarrassed for you!

665
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:06,199
You,

666
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,679
go get the documents!

667
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,439
Wen,

668
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,120
what's going on here?

669
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,080
Not having lunch now,

670
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:17,239
is Mr. Xing conducting military exercises?

671
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,719
Isn't it because of the pressure

672
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,400
from you guys?

673
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,199
Mr. Xing was at a meeting this morning,

674
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,439
and heard that you have

675
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,959
a new girl named Yuhui with

676
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,919
outstanding qualifications and experience.

677
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,080
She passed the probationary period,

678
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,439
and has got the Chunling Group

679
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:29,840
to be your client.

680
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,199
He is in a crisis.

681
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:32,080
I can't talk anymore,

682
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:32,840
I have to get the documents.

683
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,320
She passed the probationary period?

684
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,040
Ms Li,

685
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,239
I haven't seen you in days.

686
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,239
Did you go back to your hometown?

687
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:45,919
Yeah.

688
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,560
Your skin is looking better.

689
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,080
What have you been eating lately?

690
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,519
You're quite the charmer.

691
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,840
Even the actresses

692
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
would want to learn from you!

693
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,199
Here.

694
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:55,679
That's too much,

695
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,439
I won't even be able to finish it.

696
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,800
- Next. - Thank you.

697
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,279
Must be lonely eating by yourself.

698
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:16,840
Lonely?

699
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,919
Of course.

700
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,999
I feel so bad that no one can share

701
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,679
this good food with me.

702
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,360
Having chicken while

703
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,519
looking at the muscular men

704
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,560
in your phone,

705
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,239
isn't it too much?

706
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,199
The old ones

707
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:34,519
will be too much.

708
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,320
These young men just over

709
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,040
their 20s

710
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
are very fresh.

711
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,320
Have you heard?

712
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,800
Boss has turned in

713
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:48,959
the report.

714
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,439
Yuhui has passed.

715
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:51,640
He really is something,

716
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,959
didn't leak anything.

717
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:55,160
They're in such good shape!

718
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:01,279
When I passed by

719
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,120
Section Two earlier,

720
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,560
Mr. Xing,

721
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,239
you know,

722
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,400
he's yelling.

723
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,320
Such a beautiful body!

724
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,439
He's taking Yuhui as a role model,

725
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,120
telling

726
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:08,919
his people

727
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,439
to learn from her,

728
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,320
and raise crisis awareness!

729
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:12,919
If Yuhui

730
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,199
got any better,

731
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,640
even I would have that awareness.

732
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,519
Did you hear me?

733
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,439
Mr. Zhao,

734
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,279
can you please shut up

735
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,999
and leave me in peace with my phone?

736
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:24,959
Watch me have fun with him.

737
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,679
Just eat your meal.

738
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:29,080
Fanggang.

739
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,999
Stop talking so much.

740
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,519
You're here too.

741
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,439
You didn't see us

742
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,640
all this time?

743
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:35,439
No, I didn't.

744
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:36,919
Fanggang,

745
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,999
why do you tell everything

746
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,560
to Jing first?

747
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,439
Do I?

748
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,439
Does he?

749
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,519
Is it true?

750
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,279
Are you sure?

751
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,679
Then I need to ask Mr. Zhao.

752
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:51,880
Do you have any

753
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,959
special feelings for me?

754
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,160
Of course.

755
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,040
You're the first person

756
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,120
I think about

757
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,080
when I open my eyes in the morning,

758
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,959
and before I go to sleep at night.

759
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,999
I just wonder,

760
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:09,600
Jing,

761
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:14,999
when are you going to

762
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:15,759
return my money?

763
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,919
Boring.

764
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,840
Bummer.

765
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:32,719
2,000 more.

766
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,400
No can do.

767
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,120
500?

768
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,040
Not even one.

769
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,560
Then I'll let you see

770
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:42,840
these good men.

771
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:43,400
No need.

772
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:57,560
You've done so much

773
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,439
for this project.

774
00:33:58,999 --> 00:33:59,759
To be fair,

775
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:00,919
you will be able to sign it.

776
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,320
I'm telling you,

777
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,679
I heard

778
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,999
that Tang Yuhui

779
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:06,759
has signed some

780
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,479
new project.

781
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,880
She looked so arrogant,

782
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,800
making me mistakenly

783
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,640
think that she's become the president.

784
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,640
You can't lose to her.

785
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,519
She was never

786
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,919
a competitor for my permanent position.

787
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Plus I don't really want to

788
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,560
compete with her.

789
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,999
It's just that this project

790
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,320
is crucial for me

791
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,120
to get changed.

792
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,320
And I've fought hard

793
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,239
for it.

794
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm always afraid any mistakes.

795
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,120
No worries.

796
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,160
You've definitely got it.

797
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,839
Only you will always believe in me.

798
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,120
I trust you.

799
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,679
Is Qi Yu's

800
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,480
written test results out?

801
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,279
Not yet.

802
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,560
He is very nervous.

803
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,480
But I think it's really nothing.

804
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,640
At worst, I'll just go head-to-head

805
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,440
with my dad,

806
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,719
or go behind his back

807
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,399
and deal with

808
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,319
the consequences later.

809
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,040
Then,

810
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,879
since I've done this before,

811
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,679
I have to warn you...

812
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,319
Wait a second,

813
00:34:59,239 --> 00:34:59,960
I've thought about it.

814
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,080
I won't be able to

815
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,199
handle your hardship.

816
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,440
Forget it.

817
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,199
Have a bite first!

818
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:10,160
C'mon!

819
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,560
Don't disturb me.

820
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:13,640
I have to praise Yuhui.

821
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,000
Ever since

822
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,960
she joined us,

823
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:17,440
her performance has always been great.

824
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:18,359
Especially, she's

825
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,719
officially got the loan deal

826
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,040
with Chunling.

827
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,839
It's truly good

828
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,080
for a newcomer.

829
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,199
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

830
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,160
I'll keep it up.

831
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:32,120
If there's anything

832
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,080
that you don't understand

833
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,319
in the following procedures,

834
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,120
Xu Li,

835
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:35,920
you should help her out more.

836
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,679
Got it.

837
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,440
Xiaoning,

838
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,199
come to my office.

839
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,000
That's all.

840
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:46,879
Xiaoning,

841
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:48,399
remember to explain

842
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,679
the necessity and advantages

843
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,879
of the project clearly to our boss.

844
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,440
Don't be nervous.

845
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,480
Just let me know when needed.

846
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:53,799
Xiaoning,

847
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,440
it's just a declaration.

848
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,160
Take it easy.

849
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:57,600
Hold on and you'll get through it.

850
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:58,520
Yeah.

851
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,399
The boss also knows

852
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,440
that this is your first declaration,

853
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,640
he won't be too hard on you.

854
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,520
Keep it up!

855
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,239
Take it easy!

856
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,120
Keep it up!

857
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,839
Thank you.

858
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,600
I got it.

859
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,679
You asked me this morning

860
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,759
to check it thoroughly, right?

861
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,920
So I

862
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,520
checked again all the information

863
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,719
on the company,

864
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
including that on their employees

865
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,440
and their clients.

866
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,199
All done.

867
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,480
Stop doing

868
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,679
this project.

869
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,359
Stop it?

870
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:31,679
What do you mean?

871
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:32,839
To be honest,

872
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,440
this project

873
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:35,759
won't be able to apply for a loan.

874
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,399
So you need to hurry and find another one.

875
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:41,960
Why?

876
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,239
What's wrong?

877
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:47,640
Mr. Yang has been in prison,

878
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,319
he has a record.

879
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,279
The ordinary examinations

880
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,839
are far from enough

881
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:53,600
with some companies.

882
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,520
Because they

883
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,759
won't show

884
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,040
any prison record from long ago.

885
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,160
Of course,

886
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,399
very few people know

887
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:02,719
about his time in prison.

888
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,319
There have been rumors before

889
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,040
that he didn't apply for a loan

890
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,759
not 'cause he's unwilling,

891
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:11,759
but 'cause he's not qualified.

892
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,440
Then,

893
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,480
go hurry and find another project.

894
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't get discouraged.

895
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:24,319
I won't.

896
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,359
But

897
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,120
I need some time.

898
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:49,120
Xiaoning, why that face?

899
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,679
Failed?

900
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:53,040
Didn't I tell you to

901
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,759
explain to him clearly?

902
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,199
It's not possible.

903
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,520
I've looked through the documents.

904
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,160
All okay.

905
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:04,719
I don't understand.

906
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,679
This project was overseen

907
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:08,239
by the boss himself.

908
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:09,359
How can the declaration

909
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,199
not be passed?

910
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:11,120
You're right.

911
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:11,920
It shouldn't be.

912
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,960
Maybe there's...

913
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,679
Get back to work.

914
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,080
I'll go ask

915
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:22,879
and find out more.

916
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:30,399
Hello, Mr. Liu.

917
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:31,600
Yeah,

918
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,719
all good.

919
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,839
I'll send the details of the contract

920
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:35,319
to you later.

921
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,480
Okay.

922
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,879
It's just a small project.

923
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:53,839
You just started

924
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,080
doing this and have no experience.

925
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:56,239
This is normal.

926
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,560
Don't feel too bad.

927
00:38:58,319 --> 00:38:58,799
No,

928
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,839
I don't feel bad.

929
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:00,960
It's okay.

930
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:01,719
I'm fine.

931
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,879
Actually,

932
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,279
the due diligence of your project

933
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:07,160
should've been done by you.

934
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:08,679
But I was afraid

935
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,759
that you would've made a mistake,

936
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:11,319
so I did some more for you.

937
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,120
You did the research?

938
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:15,160
Yeah!

939
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,000
Yuheng didn't tell you?

940
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,679
Maybe he's worried you'll be embarrassed.

941
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:24,000
After all you've been here

942
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,000
longer than me.

943
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,799
It wouldn't be appropriate for me

944
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,600
discover this first.

945
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,640
How did you figure it out?

946
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:34,960
Yang Jie,

947
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
could you talk to Mr. Yang

948
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,640
some more?

949
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,560
Yuhui,

950
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,399
I've already tried my best.

951
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,040
Have a drink.

952
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,719
But this loan is very important to me.

953
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,279
He is my first client.

954
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,239
I can't lose it to anyone else.

955
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
This loan probably

956
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,239
won't get approved.

957
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,759
What do you mean?

958
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,120
I'm grateful to you

959
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,920
for introducing me

960
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,120
to a new sales channel.

961
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,600
As your friend,

962
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,040
I hope you can understand

963
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,080
that a setback may turn out

964
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
to be a blessing in disguise.

965
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:06,199
Let's drink.

966
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:06,679
Let it go.

967
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,399
As account managers,

968
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,199
if we lacked even this level

969
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,080
of professional sensitivity,

970
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:13,560
then we might not be

971
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,359
well-suited for this line of work.

972
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,520
Alright,

973
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,399
by the way.

974
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:21,399
Congratulations!

975
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,399
Thank you!

976
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,440
Xu Li,

977
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,080
what's up?

978
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,839
I'm about to go home.

979
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,160
I don't have

980
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,879
the brewery's documents.

981
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:49,399
Rao Jing has them.

982
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,879
You scared me.

983
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:22,000
Why are you here?

984
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,679
I'm here for the brewery's documents.

985
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,120
I'm leaving right away.

986
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,080
You even put on perfume?

987
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,000
I...

988
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,560
wanna be an elegant working man.

989
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,359
Is there a problem with that?

990
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,040
Not at all.

991
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:37,560
Wait a second.

992
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:39,879
Throw this out for me, please.

993
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:52,839
Um, do you want to

994
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:53,640
wait inside?

995
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,160
It's none of my business.

996
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:09,759
It's not my house.

997
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:10,279
It's not like

998
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,239
I care about her a lot.

999
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,440
I can't look at this anymore.

1000
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,120
How can she not wash

1001
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,480
all these clothes?

1002
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,799
There are so many.

1003
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,440
I left an annex

1004
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,560
at the bank.

1005
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,719
If you're in a hurry

1006
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,679
you'll need to pick it up.

1007
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,399
What are you doing?

1008
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,440
Don't misunderstand.

1009
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
I'm not taking care of you.

1010
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:41,239
I just couldn't look at them anymore.

1011
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,000
I have germophobia.

1012
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,920
If it's true,

1013
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,359
why are you an account manager?

1014
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,480
You should've been a janitor.

1015
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,000
Earn money while pursuing your hobby.

1016
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:54,839
You have a point.

1017
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,679
Then I'll use your house

1018
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,440
as a trial run.

1019
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,440
I'll give you 50% off.

1020
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,199
Do you know about the situation

1021
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,040
of the owner of the brewery?

1022
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,960
He worked at the

1023
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,319
Dajiang Brewery before.

1024
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:12,160
Then,

1025
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,359
he worked at

1026
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,279
the Augerta Brewery.

1027
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,359
After, he quit

1028
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:17,239
and went to Shanghai.

1029
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,759
I'll get lunch for you for 3 days,

1030
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,679
and an afternoon tea

1031
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:49,319
from the store downstairs.

1032
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,239
No more than that.

1033
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,960
The accuracy rate

1034
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,040
of the math summer homework

1035
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,920
worth only that much?

1036
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,759
Xiaoning and I haven't finish it yet.

1037
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,199
Do you think the accuracy rate

1038
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,560
is what's important to us?

1039
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:00,759
The important thing is,

1040
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,719
we go back to school today.

1041
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,399
The class starts tomorrow.

1042
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:03,960
We have to turn in all the homework.

1043
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:05,440
Give it to me.

1044
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,399
No, no way.

1045
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:08,160
I'll lend it to you,

1046
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:09,040
for free.

1047
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,759
Which class is this math homework from?

1048
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,960
There are several solutions

1049
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,679
to a question.

1050
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,759
So hardworking!

1051
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,719
Math is in the first class.

1052
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,480
English is in the second class.

1053
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:23,359
Geology is in the third class.

1054
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,679
Didn't even write their name.

1055
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,799
What a good nameless hero!
