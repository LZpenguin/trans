[You Are My Secret]
[EP28]

3
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,080
[Starting today,]

4
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,160
[I will be temporarily stepping in]

5
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,119
[as the general manager.]

6
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,599
Let me introduce to you:

7
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,440
this is Yuan Lang.

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,399
And Ren Tingting.

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,360
They are our new account managers.

10
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,000
Come on,

11
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,239
let's get to know each other.

12
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,200
Hello everyone,

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,319
I'm Ren Tingting.

14
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,440
Hi guys, I'm Yuan Lang.

15
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,360
Let's assign

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
the tasks at hand.

17
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:58,840
First up,

18
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,399
Xu Li,

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,599
you go and

20
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,879
reconcile deposit account with Yuhui

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,720
from Shunjue for the next quarter.

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,560
Come again, Jing?

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,399
You heard me right.

24
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:06,920
The "Yuhui."

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,039
The "Yuhui?"

26
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:09,200
[A reminder for you.]

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,000
[Maintain a professional distance.]

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,000
[Performance is what matters,]

29
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:12,640
got it?

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,479
Got it.

31
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,440
Li Xiang,

32
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,920
follow up the progress

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,039
on the loan from the

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,359
foreign trade company in Chengnan district.

35
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,199
Yes, Jing.

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,680
Xiaoning, sweetie,

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,599
regarding the domestic LC for that

38
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,560
microenterprise we met a few days ago,

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,479
they felt our quote

40
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,120
was too high.

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,799
[They'd like to apply for a discount.]

42
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,960
[You go and check if there's]

43
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,560
any room for a discount

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,240
that we can offer them?

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,240
Sure, Jing.

46
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,199
Ms. Rao,

47
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,879
regarding the LC,

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
I've handled a few cases with the manager

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,199
at another branch recently.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,919
Could you please also let me in on this?

51
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:38,919
I thought

52
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,799
you two just joined the team,

53
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:41,599
and will take some time to get familiar

54
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,560
with the business within section one.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,680
Since you're so

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,160
ambitious,

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,199
you can team up with Xiaoning

58
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,039
on that project.

59
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:48,280
Alright.

60
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:49,199
OK.

61
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Sir, you're something.

62
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,400
Not paying back the principal,

63
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
not paying interest,

64
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,680
and refusing to negotiate.

65
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,919
You're not shy of

66
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,680
being a deadbeat at all.

67
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,479
I think you're just

68
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,400
taking a chance,

69
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,720
thinking that the bank

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,280
won't bother with this

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,879
small amount of money

72
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,520
and we won't just sue you.

73
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:10,960
Please keep in mind,

74
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:11,840
the bank

75
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,160
isn't exactly a soft target.

76
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,160
In addition to filing a lawsuit,

77
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,479
the court can also initiate a

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
forced auction to compensate our losses.

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,879
I just took a look around

80
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,680
at your

81
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,520
aquaculture facilities.

82
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,720
And they actually look quite profitable.

83
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,400
If we really put them up for auction,

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,319
we might get a

85
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,120
juicy compensation out of them.

86
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,799
If you fail to repay,

87
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:28,680
we could simply

88
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,879
sell all these

89
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,479
properties off.

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,520
Alternatively,

91
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,479
through the right of recovery,

92
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,440
we can reclaim those loans

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,120
from your third-party properties.

94
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,319
I hope you'll consider my advice.

95
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,799
no matter which route you choose,

96
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,680
It's not in your best interest.

97
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,359
It will become challenging for you

98
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:44,120
to pursue fish farming business

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,160
in the future.

100
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,079
So think it through.

101
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,039
Hey, honey,

102
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,039
I am just off from

103
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,240
Yuheng's friend's company.

104
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,919
The account manager here

105
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,759
is taking his parent

106
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,520
to Beijing for medical treatment.

107
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,560
He asked me to fill in for two months.

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,560
You know what?

109
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,160
The pay here is really generous!

110
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,960
How's going with you?

111
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,759
Ms. Manager.

112
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,879
How did your first day go?

113
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:07,720
By the way,

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,359
You only had a bun for breakfast, right?

115
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
You must be starving by now.

116
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,199
I'll bring you some cheese pancakes.

117
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,960
No, I'm really not hungry.

118
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,759
I'm good.

119
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,319
I don't want them.

120
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,720
Stop nagging.

121
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm in the middle of

122
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,039
a discussion with Xiaoning.

123
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:20,639
Just hold on a sec.

124
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,000
[Don't order food delivery.]

125
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,000
[I'll bring you lunch instead.]

126
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,400
[I'll whip up some]

127
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,559
[braised pork chops with scallions,]

128
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,239
minced meat with eggplant,

129
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,280
and fried Hangzhou cabbage.

130
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,799
[I'll make sure it's light.]

131
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,760
I promise it will be nutritious

132
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,640
and won't add any extra pounds.

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,080
Fine, fine.

134
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,599
Got it.

135
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:34,599
Do as you please.

136
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,799
That's so sweet!

137
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,960
What's sweet about him?

138
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,999
Guess what he

139
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:42,919
told me on the phone?

140
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,559
He told me not to burn myself out.

141
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,999
Is that even realistic?

142
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,559
You know, in just a few months,

143
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,359
my belly will start to show!

144
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,960
I have to give birth soon.

145
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,400
Before that happens,

146
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,080
I need to deliver some results.

147
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,960
Otherwise,

148
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,039
I could easily lose this

149
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,479
acting manager position.

150
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,919
Marriage and motherhood are

151
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,999
the biggest hurdles for career women.

152
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,760
I'm really feeling this

153
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,679
firsthand now.

154
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,799
It's challenging.

155
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,400
Take it easy,

156
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:07,119
Jing.

157
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,439
With your skills,

158
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
you'll definitely drop the "acting"

159
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,160
before you go on maternity leave.

160
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:14,439
Besides,

161
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,400
aren't we all here for you,

162
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,439
your right-hand and left-hand support?

163
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,400
What's there to worry about?

164
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,280
That's a good point.

165
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,439
I hope so too.

166
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,239
About the letter of credit,

167
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,439
I need to discuss it with you.

168
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,799
If we can't compete with

169
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,880
the state-owned banks,

170
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:28,439
how about we

171
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
explore a different cooperation approach?

172
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:36,960
Mr. Ji,

173
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:37,720
he really agreed

174
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,799
to start repaying the interest next week?

175
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
How did you pull that off?

176
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,599
Every time we approached him before,

177
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,599
he wouldn't say a word.

178
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,160
It left us talking until we were hoarse,

179
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,880
and it was still all in vain.

180
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
You know, before I came here,

181
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:48,640
I did some digging into his background.

182
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,559
He's a local.

183
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,559
He's very attached to his hometown.

184
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,239
Outside of the village,

185
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,799
he doesn't own any fixed assets.

186
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,119
So when dealing with someone like him,

187
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,119
threatening him with being

188
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,039
labeled on the discredit list

189
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:58,999
and restricting his spending,

190
00:05:58,999 --> 00:05:59,919
like banning him from flying,

191
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,559
is completely ineffective.

192
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,039
What he truly values

193
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,840
is the key point for our negotiation.

194
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,720
Mr. Ji, your acumen is remarkable.

195
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,960
You not only excel in negotiation,

196
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,039
but you also have a grasp of psychology.

197
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,559
With you leading our branch,

198
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,640
those bad debts now

199
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,080
have a chance of recovery.

200
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,239
After a busy morning with me,

201
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:14,960
you've all put in a lot of effort.

202
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,359
After we get back to the office,

203
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:16,999
let's order some coffee.

204
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:17,720
It's on me.

205
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,239
Thanks, Mr. Ji.

206
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:19,880
Let's go.

207
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,119
Coffee?

208
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
Why did you get so much coffee?

209
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,200
[Just wanted to show you that I miss you.]

210
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,880
You bought all these

211
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,039
so I could bribe my colleagues?

212
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,280
[I am the one bribing them here.]

213
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,999
[While I'm not around,]

214
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,359
[I'd like them to say]

215
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,679
[something nice about me.]

216
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,999
They still haven't returned yet?

217
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,599
Have some coffee.

218
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,080
Wow, that's a lot of coffee!

219
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,320
This, um...

220
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,960
From a client?

221
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,359
I wouldn't accept coffee from a client.

222
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,479
I'll help myself then.

223
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,720
It's from our former boss.

224
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,479
The boss!

225
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,679
I knew the boss

226
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,840
still thinks of us.

227
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,679
In comparison with him,

228
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,239
Fanggang is

229
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,160
so scrimping.

230
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,280
He made me deliver

231
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,599
lunch to Jing every day

232
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,400
and never bought me dinner.

233
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,200
The boss is truly a great guy.

234
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,320
Even while busy with work,

235
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,039
he still has you on his mind.

236
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Thanks to you, we've got coffee as well.

237
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,439
Your relationship

238
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,039
is sweeter than coffee itself.

239
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,119
You are the sweet one here, aren't you?

240
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
I might spill the beans to Fanggang.

241
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,439
You guys are back. Have some coffee!

242
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,479
Wow, it's a wonderful day today!

243
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
We've got coffee to savor.

244
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,080
It's from the former boss.

245
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:01,599
Come on, come on!

246
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,599
Let's share.

247
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,160
Thank you!

248
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,320
Thanks! We'll take this one.

249
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,760
Here, here.

250
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,439
Grab this.

251
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:06,760
This coffee smells absolutely divine!

252
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,679
When it comes to experience,

253
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,359
we're just as qualified as Tu Xiaoning.

254
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,919
Is it really appropriate for Ms. Rao

255
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,720
to have her lead us?

256
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,960
She is quite capable, though.

257
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,320
She's someone who has made her way with

258
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,999
Weiji Company.

259
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,200
Working with her,

260
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,559
you're bound to gain valuable insights.

261
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,919
You're so naive.

262
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,760
Whether she was the one who secured

263
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,479
that project is still up for debate.

264
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,039
Isn't the last manager of section one,

265
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,999
Mr. Ji, her boyfriend? Given his position.

266
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,439
It's only natural that she would

267
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,080
receive some dividends and credit

268
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,880
from him.

269
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,520
Now Mr. Ji

270
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,400
has been reassigned to the countryside

271
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,320
because of their relationship.

272
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,080
She's likely

273
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,160
not going to achieve much.

274
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,839
You guys are having a chat, huh?

275
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,120
Xiao...

276
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Xiaoning...

277
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:46,600
Sipping on someone's coffee,

278
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,679
let's not gossip about his girlfriend.

279
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:51,600
This afternoon,

280
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,839
I'll meet a client regarding the LC.

281
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,559
Yuan Lang,

282
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,919
if you're free,

283
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,839
come along with me.

284
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,120
Absolutely.

285
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,360
Shentong Bank is just across the street.

286
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
You set the meeting in here.

287
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,039
Aren't you concerned that the client

288
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,760
might go straight to the other side?

289
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,439
I'm not meeting with a client,

290
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
but an account manager from Shentong.

291
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,799
[Regarding the letter of credit,]

292
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,520
[I've already]

293
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,799
[discussed it with the global department.]

294
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,760
Even if we

295
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
waive the fees,

296
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,160
our quotation

297
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,919
still couldn't possibly be more

298
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,360
competitive than what Shentong,

299
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,199
a state-owned bank offers.

300
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,199
One of the main reasons companies

301
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:26,919
opt for letters of credit

302
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,520
is to effectively manage cash flow

303
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
and control their overall expenses.

304
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:30,959
Since we can't

305
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,079
help them save money,

306
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:33,400
it's natural they'll seek other options.

307
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,799
But we can't just

308
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,400
offer Shentong our clients

309
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,039
for free, right?

310
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,400
Who said I want to give them away?

311
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,039
We're aiming for collaboration here.

312
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:42,520
I've already discussed it with Ms. Rao.

313
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,520
By partnering with Shentong,

314
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,240
we can exchange clients with them.

315
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,559
This way, we can help clients

316
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,799
save a significant amount of money,

317
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,400
and also do Shentong

318
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,039
a favor.

319
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,319
They would definitely appreciate

320
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,799
swapping companies

321
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:55,799
that have difficulty dealing

322
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,799
with state-owned banks.

323
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:58,559
This creates a win-win situation,

324
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,839
a positive cycle for all involved.

325
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,559
Hello!

326
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,199
Hello!

327
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:05,880
You must be Mr. Qiao.

328
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,679
Yes, nice to meet you.

329
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,319
I'm Qiao Mu.

330
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,880
It's a pleasure working with you.

331
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,880
Nice to meet you, I'm Tu Xiaoning.

332
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,319
Please, take a seat.

333
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,280
This is my colleague, Yuan Lang.

334
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,160
Nice to meet you!

335
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,400
We've previously discussed that

336
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,280
small and microenterprise that is

337
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,799
applying for credit loans.

338
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,679
You're likely aware of their situation.

339
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,559
What can you

340
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,360
tell us about the company

341
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
you're looking to swap with us?

342
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:25,919
Here's the situation:

343
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,559
the client specializes in bedding products.

344
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,160
Their facilities have been mortgaged to us.

345
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,439
Now they want to use the

346
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:32,520
vacant land behind the facilities

347
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,640
as collateral to secure a loan.

348
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,240
However, Shentong can't provide them

349
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:36,600
with the interest rate they're seeking.

350
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,400
Have you had a chance to review

351
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
their

352
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,640
tax documentation?

353
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:41,280
Absolutely.

354
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Their company adheres to

355
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,400
proper financial protocols.

356
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,360
If Mr. Qiao feels

357
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,199
there are no issues, we can start with

358
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,839
gathering the necessary documents

359
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,799
and submit them for approval.

360
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,199
We can apply for credit and the

361
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,520
associated benefits simultaneously.

362
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,240
Once we receive the credit authorization,

363
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,280
if they find the interest rate acceptable,

364
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,000
they can proceed to withdrawal.

365
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,959
How about that?

366
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,039
[That sounds good to me.]

367
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,679
[I'll also prioritize the processing]

368
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,679
[of the letter of credit.]

369
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:04,120
Perfect!

370
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
I'll send you their tax documents

371
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,880
as soon as possible.

372
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,880
Ms. Tu,

373
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,600
thank you for referring the client to me.

374
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,240
It really helped me

375
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,919
meet a target.

376
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,240
No need to mention it.

377
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,039
Our quotation

378
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,120
is indeed not competitive.

379
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,600
By doing this,

380
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,559
we can help the client

381
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,520
save a substantial amount on expenses.

382
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:19,400
At the end of the day,

383
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,640
it's all about putting their needs first.

384
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:22,079
We're just

385
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,880
having each other's backs.

386
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:23,679
Exactly!

387
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,039
Let's aim for more collaboration soon.

388
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:25,919
Absolutely!

389
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,480
[Later, as we were leaving,]

390
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,039
Yuan Lang even apologized to me,

391
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:31,839
saying he

392
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,280
shouldn't have spoken about me that way.

393
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,360
Honestly, I'm quite capable.

394
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,799
I'm not the type to rely on men.

395
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,480
So how did you respond?

396
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:42,799
I told him,

397
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:43,520
of course,

398
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,120
with Mr. Ji,

399
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,600
we each stand on our own.

400
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,039
But together, we're truly unmatched.

401
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,240
Did you really tell him that?

402
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,319
Of course not!

403
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:51,719
If I said that,

404
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,799
that would be way too cheesy!

405
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,880
But honestly, that's how I feel inside.

406
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,160
I feel the same way.

407
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,400
In my heart, you are the

408
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,160
most exceptional person in the world.

409
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,959
They just don't see your true worth.

410
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:06,319
Today, that

411
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,000
account manager from Shentong

412
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,079
also complimented me like that.

413
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,199
His name is

414
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,520
Qiao Mu.

415
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:14,760
Do you know him?

416
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,000
He's said to be one of

417
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,120
the four cutest men at Shentong.

418
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,439
The four cutest men, huh?

419
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,439
Is he cuter than me?

420
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,679
Just

421
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,559
a little bit, I suppose.

422
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,839
A little bit, huh?

423
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,839
A little bit!

424
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:37,919
Do you know how much I

425
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,679
missed you today?

426
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,319
Don't worry,

427
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,559
I'll definitely get reassigned back soon.

428
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,480
[Xiaoning,]

429
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,719
[I'm here to drop off the documents.]

430
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,880
[I'm waiting for you]

431
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,679
[in the parking lot downstairs.]

432
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,919
Just hold on a moment.

433
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,679
I'll be right there.

434
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,199
Qiao Mu!

435
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,679
Try this coffee

436
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,400
from the new café.

437
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:33,120
Thank you so much.

438
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
It's very kind of you.

439
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,360
Mr. Ji?

440
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,919
What brings you here?

441
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:46,880
I need to finish some transfer paperwork.

442
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,439
And who is this?

443
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,520
Hello, Mr. Ji.

444
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,319
I'm Qiao Mu from Shentong.

445
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,000
We've got similar tastes.

446
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,319
This coffee is from the new café.

447
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:56,360
I just bought some for you yesterday.

448
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,640
How was it?

449
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,400
It's quite good.

450
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,839
Mr. Ji, would you like to give it a try?

451
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,520
I just drove over and I'm a bit tired.

452
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:09,520
Thank you!

453
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,559
I've organized all the files

454
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,240
needed for the LC based on

455
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,400
your global department's requirements.

456
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:24,280
I'll send you the

457
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,919
scanned copies of the

458
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,160
submission letter of

459
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,839
the domestic letter of credit shortly.

460
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,880
Then I'll send the

461
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,079
originals to you afterwards.

462
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,199
Thank you!

463
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,760
OK.

464
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,959
No problem at all.

465
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,959
I'll see you around.

466
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,520
Thanks!

467
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,360
So this is one of the legendary

468
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,799
four cutest men of Shentong, huh?

469
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,839
Zhao Fanggang would be considered

470
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,000
a top-tier cute guy at their bank.

471
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,199
Mr. Ji, usually,

472
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,120
you don't wear the ring at work.

473
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,199
Why are you wearing it today?

474
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm doing it on purpose.

475
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,719
It's important to show that I'm taken,

476
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,559
especially in a professional setting.

477
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,439
Was that gesture you just made

478
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,719
a bit too obvious?

479
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:58,520
Ignore it.

480
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,039
Whose car is that?

481
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:04,480
It's yours.

482
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,799
Mine?

483
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,760
Mine?!

484
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:10,520
It's a gift.

485
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,000
I just received a bonus.

486
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,760
How do you justify such lavish spending?

487
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,520
It's not lavish at all.

488
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,039
You really need a car.

489
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,839
And I know

490
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,559
the dealer.

491
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,520
That's why I chose this model.

492
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,079
I've placed your vehicle registration

493
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,199
and driver's license in the compartment.

494
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
I've also prepared tissues

495
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,679
for your daily use.

496
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:30,760
Additionally,

497
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,919
the dashcam

498
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,120
has been tested and is ready to go.

499
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:33,919
You don't need to worry about anything.

500
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,880
[Giving me such an expensive gift]

501
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,839
[all of a sudden,]

502
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,679
[is he planning to propose?]

503
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,719
Why are you suddenly giving me

504
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,360
such an expensive gift?

505
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,880
In the past,

506
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,760
we could commute together.

507
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,160
Even in bad weather,

508
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,039
we wouldn't have to worry.

509
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,839
Now that I work in Nanan County,

510
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
if the weather turns bad one day,

511
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,839
or if you're working late,

512
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,520
you driving it will give me peace of mind.

513
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,959
That's it?

514
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:02,039
Well then,

515
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Isn't this a bit too pricey?

516
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,719
Isn't it a bit too showy?

517
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,120
Not at all.

518
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,120
Besides,

519
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,280
you're now

520
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,360
an account manager for Dairui.

521
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,120
You're a veteran on the team.

522
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,679
This car is perfectly suited for you.

523
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,520
It's just right.

524
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
It's great.

525
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,760
What do you mean by "great"?

526
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,079
I think Mr. Ji's fortune

527
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:24,839
is great as well.

528
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,600
You got here just in time to see Qiao Mu.

529
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,719
You gave me such a

530
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,240
generous gift right in front of him.

531
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,120
I bet in a few days,

532
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
Mr. Ji will earn

533
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,439
the title of

534
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,319
"Wife Spoiling Maniac."

535
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,640
Looks like this

536
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,719
gift really works on you.

537
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,600
Absolutely.

538
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:38,799
I love it.

539
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,120
Thank you.

540
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,520
What matters most is that you like it.

541
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:50,480
Jing!

542
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,400
Mr. Ji!

543
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,039
Long time no see!

544
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,559
Good to see you again.

545
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,319
What brings you here

546
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,719
in the middle of the day?

547
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,240
Having a heart-to-heart with Xiaoning?

548
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,520
No problem.

549
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,199
Don't be shy.

550
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:01,959
You kids have fun.

551
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,039
I'm going upstairs now.

552
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,039
I'll be there soon, Jing.

553
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,480
OK.

554
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:05,839
See ya!

555
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,160
During work hours,

556
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
out on a date,

557
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,400
caught by the boss,

558
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,719
that's just too awkward!

559
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,040
I can't help you with that.

560
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,120
You'll have to face it alone.

561
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:15,040
You

562
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,040
park the car in the underground parking.

563
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,040
Leave the keys to Ling Weiyi.

564
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,479
Yes, Ms. Tu.

565
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,679
I'm off then.

566
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,519
OK.

567
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,239
Jing,

568
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,320
didn't you go to the newly built

569
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,640
private high school this afternoon

570
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:37,840
to discuss payroll?

571
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,080
What's up?

572
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:39,959
Was it not going well?

573
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,239
That project isn't under our jurisdiction.

574
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,040
Some else took it.

575
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:43,840
Also,

576
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,759
the contract hasn't been signed yet.

577
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,919
I'll think of another way.

578
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,679
But I feel like

579
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,320
the hope is slim.

580
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,199
We've got Shentong onboard.

581
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,360
I'll try to

582
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,239
go through the files and agreements

583
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,040
today.

584
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,800
And get them signed by tomorrow.

585
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,080
If that's the case,

586
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,040
our performance for this month

587
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,120
will be secured.

588
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:01,519
Jing,

589
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,919
don't worry.

590
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,640
Li Xiang and Xu Li,

591
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,519
their projects

592
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,919
are in the process.

593
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,600
Tingting and Yuan Lang

594
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,800
are quite enthusiastic about

595
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,679
attracting deposits.

596
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,479
Let's both put in more effort

597
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,959
and aim to develop one or two

598
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,919
new clients.

599
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,919
Before you give birth,

600
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,959
we'll definitely achieve

601
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,199
some excellent results

602
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,959
to show the higher-ups.

603
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,479
If we do that, they will

604
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,320
have more confidence in you.

605
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,880
Honestly,

606
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,040
I've been feeling quite anxious lately.

607
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,759
Don't you think I look thinner now

608
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,199
that I'm pregnant?

609
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,320
From the look of your face,

610
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,320
it's pretty noticeable.

611
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,439
Right?

612
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,719
You know, when I was an account manager,

613
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,279
I had a lot of work,

614
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,479
and the pressure was intense,

615
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:43,880
right?

616
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,600
[But after work,]

617
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,400
[I would find a place to have a drink,]

618
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,279
[and dance a bit.]

619
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,120
That would help relieve the stress.

620
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,719
But ever since I got conceived,

621
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:52,919
that Zhao guy

622
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,999
won't let me drink any booze,

623
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:54,999
or dance.

624
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,400
I really feel like...

625
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,279
Fanggang made it clear.

626
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,600
He instructed me

627
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,040
not to let you drink coffee or tea.

628
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,919
He asked me to keep an eye on you.

629
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,840
He's already given you instructions?

630
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,600
He's reaching out to my turf now?

631
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,120
This is for your own good.

632
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,959
Fine.

633
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,840
You know, when I get home,

634
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,239
I would just lie in bed

635
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,439
and play some mobile games.

636
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,040
That can help relieve some stress.

637
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,840
Let off some steam.

638
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,439
But he won't even let me play games.

639
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,479
Guess what the reason is?

640
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,320
He's afraid my teammates might suck

641
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,959
and that would affect my mood.

642
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
Then I just let it all out on him.

643
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,719
I argue with him,

644
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,279
but he doesn't even respond.

645
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,600
Whatever I say,

646
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,080
he just takes it all in.

647
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,160
So it makes me seem like

648
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,919
I have a really bad temper now.

649
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:34,919
Right now,

650
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,320
with the rise of pregnancy hormones,

651
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,400
combined with the pressure from work,

652
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,800
I feel like

653
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,199
I'm about to explode.

654
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,040
I really can't

655
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,239
hold it in anymore.

656
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,120
Xiaoning,

657
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,759
I beg you,

658
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,640
let me have a sip of coffee.

659
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,640
You and Mr. Ji are now

660
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,439
in the best phase.

661
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,160
You're both still deeply in love.

662
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,719
This step we're taking

663
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,279
is indeed quite a leap.

664
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,759
It's a bit challenging to adapt.

665
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,959
Fanggang

666
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,400
suddenly became a husband.

667
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,160
[And then,]

668
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,800
[suddenly became a soon-to-be dad.]

669
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,080
Living cautiously,

670
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,679
afraid of upsetting you.

671
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,120
Honestly, there's nothing wrong with that.

672
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:14,959
Right?

673
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,519
Yes.

674
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:17,640
So,

675
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:18,519
Jing,

676
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,679
I think,

677
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,640
without bad habits,

678
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,640
you find yourself reminiscing

679
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,600
about the good old days

680
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,840
and wanting to find an outlet

681
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,959
is perfectly understandable.

682
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:27,840
You do?

683
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,479
So,

684
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,439
I think

685
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,800
maybe the problem lies in

686
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,719
your communication.

687
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,719
[If fighting doesn't solve anything,]

688
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:35,840
then why not

689
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,880
try something else?

690
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,279
You're just a kid

691
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,279
who isn't even married yet,

692
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,080
and you're giving me advice?

693
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,080
Do you want to hear it or not?

694
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,519
Tell me.

695
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,320
I'm done.

696
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,719
Looks like you really enjoyed

697
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,640
the food today.

698
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,040
Very much so.

699
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,880
I think after this,

700
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,199
I'll gain three kilos tomorrow.

701
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,719
It's okay.

702
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
After you've given birth, I will do

703
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,040
the postpartum exercise with you.

704
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:09,560
I'll go get the folic acid for you.

705
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,439
No need.

706
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,120
I took it on time

707
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,040
and in sufficient amounts.

708
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,160
You

709
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,160
are suddenly so initiative,

710
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,519
I'm not really used to it.

711
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,120
I'm not suddenly initiative.

712
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm not a child

713
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,040
[and I'm aware that]

714
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,959
[I'm pregnant,]

715
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:23,719
of course

716
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,919
I'll take good care of myself.

717
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,439
I was always arguing with you

718
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,160
because

719
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,400
you kept controlling me!

720
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,439
But,

721
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,880
it was just bickering,

722
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
I still listened to you every time,

723
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
didn't I?

724
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,439
So that means

725
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,519
I was making some sense.

726
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,800
Not just some sense,

727
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,679
you were completely right!

728
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,320
Let me tell you again.

729
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,479
Today,

730
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,519
I had

731
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,360
some fish, some shrimps and the asparagus.

732
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,679
I also had the bird's nest soup

733
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,880
at four in the afternoon.

734
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,160
[And before getting off work,]

735
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,640
[I also finished the dried fruit]

736
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,600
you prepared for me.

737
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,880
My husband has put his heart and soul

738
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,279
into everything for me,

739
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,439
[always worrying about me.]

740
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:01,919
How could I not cooperate,

741
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:02,840
right?

742
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,479
Now,

743
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,439
are you satisfied?

744
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,360
Very mush so!

745
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,199
I'll give you a little star!

746
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,479
However, if you can agree

747
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:14,679
to something now,

748
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,999
I promise I will never

749
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,320
argue with you anymore.

750
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,160
Okay,

751
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,080
let me hear it.

752
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,800
Look,

753
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,439
it's still

754
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,120
quite early

755
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,239
and the evening is just right,

756
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,320
shouldn't we go out

757
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,759
and have some fun?

758
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,080
Where to?

759
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
To an

760
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,840
old place

761
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,999
and revisit our memories.

762
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:39,840
Honey,

763
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,959
slow down.

764
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,439
What did you say? I can't hear you!

765
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,560
Don't yell so loudly.

766
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,279
What's wrong with being loud?

767
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:45,959
It's not like being,

768
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,560
being loud

769
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,759
can hurt the baby?

770
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,239
Knock on wood!

771
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,120
Quick!

772
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,719
Knock on wood!

773
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,759
Knock on wood!

774
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,360
Knock on wood.

775
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,919
One,

776
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:52,279
two,

777
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:52,600
three.

778
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,320
So superstitious!

779
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,959
Manager,

780
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,640
I'd like to place an order.

781
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,600
I'll keep it down.

782
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:01,360
Hi, there.

783
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,919
Hello, Sir,

784
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:03,679
is there anything I can do for you?

785
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,479
Could you change the music

786
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,719
to some piano songs?

787
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,560
My heart can't take

788
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,959
this pounding beat.

789
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,080
[I'm sorry, Sir.]

790
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,040
The customers are here

791
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,919
to dance.

792
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,160
If we switch to piano music,

793
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,160
they won't be able to dance anymore.

794
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,479
Yeah, don't listen to him.

795
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,080
We'll order.

796
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,560
Okay.

797
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:16,560
I'll keep it down.

798
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,800
I'm telling you,

799
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,199
with this rhythm,

800
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,600
this beat,

801
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:23,959
our child will be born a

802
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,279
rhythm master!

803
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,600
Give me a break.

804
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:36,759
Honey,

805
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,959
haven't you been worried about

806
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,040
me developing antepartum depression?

807
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,400
If you don't want me to

808
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,719
develop antepartum depression,

809
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,479
then don't ruin my mood

810
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,679
tonight.

811
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,959
I promise you,

812
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,679
If I even feel

813
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,400
the tiniest bit unwell,

814
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,279
we'll go home immediately,

815
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,800
okay?

816
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,239
Okay?

817
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,519
Slowly.

818
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,640
I'll be slow.

819
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:04,919
With ease.

820
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,040
This is my favorite song.

821
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,679
C'mon, honey!

822
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:19,479
Since I can't dance now,

823
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,239
you go dance for me!

824
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,959
Honey,

825
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,919
honey.

826
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,719
Honey.

827
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,600
You fell asleep?

828
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:05,999
It's nonalcoholic.

829
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,080
There's not even ice in it.

830
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,479
Honey,

831
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,919
let's go home.

832
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:15,880
It's just past 9.

833
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,279
It's not everyday that we go out.

834
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,040
You go have fun.

835
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,160
I haven't been here

836
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,519
for a long time.

837
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,880
Actually, after coming here today,

838
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,719
I find it quite boring.

839
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,719
Let's go home.

840
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:32,759
Okay.

841
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,519
You tricked and coaxed me

842
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,679
into going to the bar,

843
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,640
and now you're leaving so soon.

844
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,400
Why?

845
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,199
Is it you finding it boring?

846
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:47,840
It shouldn't be.

847
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,640
Or that you're afraid

848
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:50,560
I'll scold you?

849
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:52,919
I think,

850
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:55,840
it must have been hard for you.

851
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,120
You didn't even drink anything,

852
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,479
if it weren't because

853
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,759
you were too tired,

854
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,800
how could you have fallen asleep

855
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,560
in such a noisy nightclub?

856
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:07,600
I'm

857
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,519
probably just not very into

858
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,560
this kind of places.

859
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,400
You know that.

860
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,840
I'm a mellow person.

861
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,999
This pregnancy

862
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,719
was a surprise

863
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,439
for both of us.

864
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,080
So lately

865
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,279
I've been trying to

866
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,199
get used to this new role of being a mom,

867
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,239
as well as

868
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,400
our new life together.

869
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,719
But you know sometimes

870
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,679
I can be hormonal,

871
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,400
so I might take out some of

872
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,360
my emotions on you.

873
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,439
I'm very sorry.

874
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:42,840
It really hasn't been

875
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,880
easy for you.

876
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,679
I don't have my parents anymore, so you've

877
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,400
asked your parents to look after me.

878
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,640
And then

879
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,360
you still take care of

880
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:53,120
me and the baby everyday,

881
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,400
preparing every single meal

882
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,320
for me.

883
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,120
You also took on

884
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,560
all the household chores.

885
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,919
You even have to wait for me

886
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,439
to fall asleep first

887
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,479
when you have to work overtime.

888
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:06,919
So today

889
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:07,999
I really want to tell you that,

890
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,199
thank you.

891
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,719
Is it really necessary

892
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:19,640
to make a big deal out of this?

893
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:21,919
If I can't even do this,

894
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,040
why would I get married?

895
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:26,759
You

896
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,999
have been free for more than thirty years.

897
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:30,199
The burden

898
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,239
of marriage and children

899
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:31,959
falling on your shoulder at the same time,

900
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,519
it wouldn't be easy for anyone.

901
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:36,959
I've decided,

902
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,679
I'll take you out

903
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,479
once a week from now on.

904
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,320
But you have to promise me

905
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,919
not to look at the handsome men.

906
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,560
I wasn't looking.

907
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,439
Just this once.

908
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,199
Never again.

909
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,199
Plus, are those men

910
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,719
really prettier than your husband?

911
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,719
Are they

912
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,479
more charming, more elegant

913
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,439
and more mature than your husband?

914
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,519
I really wasn't looking.

915
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:02,880
Why couldn't you believe me?

916
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:03,719
I was telling the truth.

917
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,320
Can't you handle a few honest words?

918
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,679
Wait for me.

919
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,479
[Think about it,]

920
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,840
[if our bank]

921
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,719
simply confronts

922
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,999
other businesses head-on

923
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,439
like they are the enemies,

924
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,479
it'll only end in a lose-lose situation.

925
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:17,679
Therefore, we need to find ways

926
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,880
to revitalize these companies

927
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,160
and help them regain the ability

928
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,320
to generate revenue.

929
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,360
Only this way will it be a win-win

930
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,600
for both the bank and the businesses.

931
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,959
I've looked through

932
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,160
the previous loan contracts

933
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,999
with the private companies.

10934
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,759
Deferred repayment

10935
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,519
is mainly because of

10936
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,640
the businesses.

937
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,320
But the bank

938
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,199
was not entirely faultless

939
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,640
in the lending process.

940
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,160
[We were only focused on]

941
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,439
[giving out the loans quicker.]

942
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,439
[We have never properly assessed]

943
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,560
[the businesses' actual conditions]

944
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,959
[or their needs.]

945
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:43,360
The loan amount,

946
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,320
duration,

947
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,519
and repayment method

948
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,040
were completely incompatible

949
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,840
with the businesses' conditions.

950
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,600
Let's think out of box.

951
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,080
If the businesses didn't receive

952
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,959
desirable sales revenue

953
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,120
during the repayment period,

954
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,080
how could they

955
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,239
have repaid the bank?

956
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,320
This is the real cause

957
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,719
of the situation we're in today.

958
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:03,479
Mr. Ji, we didn't really

959
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:06,120
think too much about it at the time.

960
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,080
We only wanted to

961
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,120
give out the loans quicker

962
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,320
and get the job done.

963
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,439
I don't like to dwell on the past,

964
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,400
but if these old issues

965
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,800
remain unresolved,

966
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,360
the Nan'an branch

967
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,279
will never be able to

968
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,519
bring in new clients

969
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,199
or meet the KPIs

970
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,360
set by the headquarters.

971
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,199
I'm sure you don't want to

972
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,239
be stuck with just

973
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,040
the base salary every month,

974
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,160
always missing out

975
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,239
on performance bonuses,

976
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,040
and still getting criticized

977
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,279
by upper management every day, do you?

978
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,560
Of course not, Mr. Ji.

979
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,759
But it truly hasn't been easy

980
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,840
these years.

981
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:34,999
[Mr. Ji,]

982
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,880
[what do you think]

983
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,719
[we should do?]

984
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,759
As long as we can meet

985
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,560
all the KPIs,

986
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,320
we're willing to do whatever it takes.

987
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,120
The next two months

988
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,400
you'll need to work very hard.

989
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,880
We'll need to be deeply involved

990
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,759
with each business,

991
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,519
and get a though understanding of them.

992
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,320
[If a business]

993
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,880
[is genuinely facing some problems]

994
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,959
[and difficulties,]

995
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,919
and if the owner is honest

996
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:55,840
and willing to solve them,

997
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,320
we'll work together

998
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,160
with them to find

999
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,880
solutions for these non-performing loans.

1000
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,600
What's the situation?

1001
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,679
Mr. Ji,

1002
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,600
they said he went along

1003
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:17,279
with purchasing team to buy raw materials.

1004
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,719
I don't know if that's true though.

1005
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,160
[I just knew it.]

1006
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,160
[This Mr. Sun]

1007
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,719
is the toughest case

1008
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:23,679
among the several bad loans the bank has.

1009
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,560
And he always acts like

1010
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,719
he's not afraid of anything.

1011
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,040
It's like 'I don't have any money,

1012
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,679
but take my factory if you want'.

1013
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,360
Whether we sue or auction,

1014
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,320
he doesn't care.

1015
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,080
Yeah.

1016
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,239
Initially when we came here,

1017
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,160
he was at least respectful.

1018
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,160
But in the end,

1019
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,400
he didn't even bother to pretend anymore.

1020
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,120
[He would]

1021
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,880
[simply hide]

1022
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:36,600
[every time we come here.]

1023
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,679
[I have no words]

1024
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,719
[for this person.]

1025
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:41,439
If you ask me,

1026
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:42,719
I don't think this Mr. Sun

1027
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:44,160
is truly fearless.

1028
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:45,959
He must be convinced that

1029
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,080
we don't want this loan

1030
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,160
to become non-performing

1031
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,120
this soon.

1032
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:50,560
Think about it,

1033
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,360
if a newly issued loan become

1034
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,880
non-performing within the same year,

1035
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,640
our entire branch's performance

1036
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,519
will be ruined.

1037
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,439
So the best solution now

1038
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,479
is to wait for him

1039
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,600
and negotiate to him.

1040
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,640
We'll trade the space

1041
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,719
with time.

1042
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,080
Mr. Ji,

1043
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,880
I think it's going to rain soon.

1044
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,600
We still have time anyway.

1045
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:15,759
Why don't we go home,

1046
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,679
[and come back tomorrow?]

1047
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,600
[Yeah, Mr. Ji.]

1048
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:18,959
We still have a week.

1049
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:19,679
Let's come back tomorrow.

1050
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,400
Okay then.

1051
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:22,640
Since it's going to rain soon,

1052
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,479
you guys go back,

1053
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,439
I'll wait a bit longer.

1054
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,679
It's late now.

1055
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:29,880
The kids must be home from school.

1056
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:30,800
Go home

1057
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:31,759
and make dinner for them now.

1058
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:33,080
Thank you.

1059
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:33,719
Thank you.

1060
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,600
[This Mr. Sun]

1061
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,160
[really is something.]

1062
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,080
Hello, Xiaoning.

1063
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,840
I'm still not done here.

1064
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,840
I probably won't make it back tonight.

1065
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,120
And the weather isn't good.

1066
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,040
It's about to rain.

1067
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,719
You should go to your parents' tonight,

1068
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,479
or I'll worry about you.

1069
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:03,840
[Okay.]

1070
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
[You be careful too.]

1071
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,800
[Do you have your overnight bag?]

1072
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:08,999
Of course.

1073
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,759
It's in my car.

1074
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,479
Don't worry.

1075
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,279
[Be careful.]

1076
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:13,640
[Bye bye.]

1077
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,400
Bye bye.

1078
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,519
Have some of this.

1079
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,640
It's raining heavily,

1080
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,160
and it's getting colder.

1081
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,759
Yuheng is away all alone,

1082
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:23,719
won't he get sick?

1083
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,799
He's a man.

1084
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,279
Some wind and rain

1085
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,600
is nothing.

1086
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,879
It'll only make him

1087
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,600
stronger.

1088
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,399
[Yuheng is mature and responsible.]

1089
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,279
Don't worry,

1090
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,199
he will surely take care of himself.

1091
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,319
Are you hearing what you're saying?

1092
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,799
Why don't you go outside

1093
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,960
and stay in the rain for a while

1094
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,920
and see if it

1095
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,120
makes you stronger.

1096
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm too old for that.

1097
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,799
If I

1098
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,440
do

1099
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,799
get sick,

1100
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:49,080
then

1101
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:49,600
you two

1102
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,440
will suffer as well.

1103
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,080
[But to be honest,]

1104
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:53,920
I really think Yuheng

1105
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,759
is a good man.

1106
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,120
Your dad and I are very happy with him.

1107
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,560
Right?

1108
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,359
I was really worried

1109
00:34:58,359 --> 00:34:59,359
about you

1110
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,480
before your relationship was made public.

1111
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:01,440
I was really worried about

1112
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,679
what it would do to your job.

1113
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,199
I was so anxious everyday

1114
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,040
that I couldn't sleep.

1115
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,279
But I didn't dare to tell you.

1116
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:07,239
I didn't want to bother you.

1117
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:08,279
It wouldn't.

1118
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,560
It's true.

1119
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,080
When

1120
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,040
your relationship was made public,

1121
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,679
your mom looked calm

1122
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:15,920
on the surface,

1123
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,440
but in reality,

1124
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,839
she was this close to be

1125
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,799
sent to the ICU.

1126
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,040
Can't you wish me something better?

1127
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,399
But fortunately,

1128
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:25,960
they only found out

1129
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,839
about your relationship,

1130
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,920
no one knew you've already registered.

1131
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:30,799
[If you knew that]

1132
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:32,160
[we're not really registered yet,]

1133
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,199
[you wouldn't react this way.]

1134
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:37,600
[I think Yuheng is truly a reliable man.]

1135
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:38,520
Look at how he was willing to

1136
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,399
be transferred to a little town

1137
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,359
to protect your job.

1138
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:42,839
[As parents,]

1139
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,920
If we knew someone could

1140
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,000
take care of our daughter

1141
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,120
this wholeheartedly,

1142
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,480
all of our worries

1143
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,719
would vanish.

1144
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:51,440
To be honest,

1145
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,879
Mom,

1146
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,199
before

1147
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,359
I only thought that

1148
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:55,879
we liked each other

1149
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,120
and loved each other.

1150
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,199
But,

1151
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,399
it was only through this thing that

1152
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,839
I realized I not only love him,

1153
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,640
but he is also truly someone

1154
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,839
I can spend my whole life with.

1155
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:05,839
[In the future,]

1156
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,319
[no matter what happens,]

1157
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,199
as long as we're together,

1158
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,040
we can solve anything,

1159
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,879
just like you two have.

1160
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,399
Our daughter is all grown up.

1161
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,719
Hearing this,

1162
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,040
why am I

1163
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,879
suddenly a bit sad?

1164
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:23,960
Enough,

1165
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,080
save your tears

1166
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,520
for the wedding.

1167
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,480
[Right,]

1168
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,239
how's it going with your wedding?

1169
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,799
[You've registered for almost a year now.]

1170
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:35,600
Before, it was because it might affect

1171
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:36,399
your work. So now,

1172
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
can I finally get my hopes up?

1173
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,040
We're truly a bit busy.

1174
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,440
We don't have the time.

1175
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,359
[He's just been transferred.]

1176
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,359
Besides

1177
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,679
working and sleeping,

1178
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:48,359
he spends all his time on the road.

1179
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:49,920
He doesn't have the energy.

1180
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,279
We'll wait a bit more.

1181
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:54,399
When can he be transferred back

1182
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,120
from that little town?

1183
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:58,239
It must be exhausting going back and forth.

1184
00:36:58,359 --> 00:36:58,879
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1185
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,480
This problem will be solved

1186
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,640
sooner or later.

1187
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,160
It's only a matter of time.

1188
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:04,000
I'll let you know

1189
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,879
when it's solved.

1190
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:06,319
It just occurs to me that

1191
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,879
I have some more work to do.

1192
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
You go ahead and rest.

1193
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,199
[Take this tea.]

1194
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:11,920
[Let me pour you some more.]

1195
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,560
I'm good, I'm good.

1196
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,839
Running away again from this topic.

1197
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,160
He doesn't even have time to propose,

1198
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:34,920
let alone a wedding.

1199
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:43,920
[You're still up]

1200
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,920
[at this hour?]

1201
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,600
Yeah.

1202
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:48,960
Such a beautiful night, of course

1203
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,040
I'll be spending it working overtime.

1204
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,040
[Looks like]

1205
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:53,960
[Miss Tu is very busy.]

1206
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,080
Aren't you busy as well?

1207
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,399
[It's mostly because Jing]

1208
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:00,520
[is three month pregnant now]

1209
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,920
[and suffers a lot from morning sickness.]

1210
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,399
[On top of that, this is a crucial period]

1211
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:05,399
[for her promotion to general manager.]

1212
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,440
[At least two major projects are needed]

1213
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,600
[to back it up.]

1214
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:11,080
[So, of course I must offer a hand]

1215
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,359
[and find more clients.]

1216
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,759
Then perfect,

1217
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,719
I also have a report to finish.

1218
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:17,359
Let's work together then.

1219
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,199
We'll keep each other company.

1220
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Don't just look at me.

1221
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:30,480
Focus.

1222
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,960
How would you know that I'm looking at you

1223
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,600
if you're not looking at me?

1224
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,120
Are you asleep?

1225
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:33,080
Tu Xiaoning?

1226
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,359
[Are you really asleep?]

1227
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,520
Sleep tight.

1228
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,279
Good night.

1229
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,199
[Come over, everyone!]

1230
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,239
We need to unload these raw materials!

1231
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:39,640
Okay.

1232
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,359
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

1233
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:42,560
[Quickly, quickly!]

1234
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,160
[Quickly, quickly!]

1235
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,120
[Quickly, quickly!]

1236
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,080
[Keep up!]

1237
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,640
Let's do our best!

1238
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:48,839
They will be useless if they get wet.

1239
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,560
Mister,

1240
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:50,679
what are you unloading?

1241
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,319
[Raw materials for food processing.]

1242
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,199
Mister,

1243
00:40:53,399 --> 00:40:54,640
are you Mr. Sun?

1244
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,920
How could I

1245
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,799
be the great Mr. Sun!

1246
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,719
That's Mr. Sun.

1247
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,359
He knew that my shoulder's injured

1248
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,719
and took my place.

1249
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,520
[Let's work harder, everyone!]

1250
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,239
If we sell this batch of food products,

1251
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,399
everyone

1252
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:09,000
will get their salary next month!

1253
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,160
[C'mon!]

1254
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:15,199
Here.

1255
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:57,879
Wipe if off.

1256
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,679
Take a seat.

1257
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,239
Okay.

1258
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,560
There's no other clothes in the factory.

1259
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,560
You'll have to make do with

1260
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,359
this work uniform.

1261
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,640
Okay,

1262
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,120
thank you.

1263
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:06,679
No problem.

1264
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:10,640
Mr. Sun,

1265
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,080
let me introduce myself

1266
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,879
to you.

1267
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,199
I am the new manager

1268
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,000
at the Nan'an branch

1269
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,879
of Dairui Bank.

1270
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,920
My name is Ji Yuheng,

1271
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,080
you can call me Yuheng.

1272
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,160
[I'm here today]

1273
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,319
to learn more about

1274
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:23,120
the loan and repayment situations

1275
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,719
here.

1276
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,560
As long as this factory is in my hands,

1277
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,120
I'll keep it running.

1278
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,520
If

1279
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,640
the bank must take it away,

1280
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,040
I have no choice

1281
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,359
but to retire and go back to my hometown.

1282
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:33,640
But I have no money

1283
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,799
to pay back the debts now.

1284
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,480
Mr. Sun, clam down.

1285
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:38,879
My colleague

1286
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,440
had already informed me about

1287
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:41,719
what you think

1288
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,679
and some of your ideas.

1289
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,480
This is the first time that we meet.

1290
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,279
The way you conduct yourself

1291
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,399
is truly very different

1292
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:48,960
from what I expected.

1293
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,160
I also spoke with

1294
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,040
the senior staff at the factory

1295
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,399
just now.

1296
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,040
They all support you very much,

1297
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:56,520
saying that

1298
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,719
you're in this debt

1299
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,279
because you were trapped by the bank.

1300
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,799
I just want to

1301
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:01,640
know about

1302
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,839
what the situation was

1303
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:03,799
exactly at the time.

1304
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,600
Actually,

1305
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,440
it's not the bank's fault.

1306
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
I was mostly to blame.

1307
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,239
[Back then,]

1308
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,799
[I was focused on expanding the factory]

1309
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,879
[and helping everyone have a better life.]

1310
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:17,799
At the time,

1311
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,199
many banks came to me

1312
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:21,719
and offered me a loan.

1313
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,560
[I thought that was a good thing.]

1314
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:24,520
[So,]

1315
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:25,279
[I said yes]

1316
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,000
[to all of them.]

1317
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,480
We built new plants,

1318
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,520
added more production lines.

1319
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:30,000
[However,]

1320
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:31,440
[while production increased,]

1321
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,960
sales did not.

1322
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,160
It was a large stock,

1323
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,279
all stuck in inventory and unsold.

1324
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:39,600
[The cash flow]

1325
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:40,839
has also dried up.

1326
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,799
I couldn't

1327
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,719
repay the bank loans,

1328
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,480
let alone having the money

1329
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,319
to expand

1330
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,199
some new sales channels.

1331
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:49,719
I have an idea.

1332
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:51,239
I don't know if

1333
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:51,879
you're willing to try it.

1334
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:33,600
Hello, Mr. Liu.

1335
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:35,279
Are you still up?

1336
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,920
[Mr. Ji, you're still up.]

1337
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:38,279
[Do you want to go grab a drink?]

1338
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:39,160
Thanks,

1339
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,600
I'm good.

1340
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:40,440
It's a bit late today.

1341
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,000
There's something I want to ask you.

1342
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:43,920
Can I

1343
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,879
pick up the car

1344
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:46,279
I ordered from you this week?

1345
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,319
[I think so.]

1346
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:49,839
[I'll let you know when it gets here.]

1347
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:50,239
Okay,

1348
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:50,960
sure.

1349
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,080
Thank you

1350
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,719
for going through all that trouble.

1351
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:54,239
[No problem.]

1352
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:54,640
[It's nothing.]

1353
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:55,239
[Then I'll hang up then.]

1354
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:55,719
Okay.

1355
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,440
Thank you.

1356
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,520
[Xiaoning,]

1357
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,279
[when I'm not around, let this]

1358
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,600
[protect you from the wind and rain]

1359
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,199
[and take you anywhere you want to go]

1360
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,759
[whenever you want.]
