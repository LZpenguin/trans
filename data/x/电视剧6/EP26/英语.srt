00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,760
You Are My Secret EP26

3
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,640
I can tolerate a lot,

4
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,640
but I shouldn't tolerate a woman

5
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,759
singing love songs

6
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,720
to my fiancé

7
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,759
right in front of me.

8
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,440
Especially on my birthday.

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,519
That's just outrageous.

10
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,560
A love that can't be made public

11
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,920
is really difficult.

12
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,879
You know how much I care about you.

13
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:06,560
Do you really have to

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,479
push me away?

15
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,160
And you know very well

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,360
that without the backing of those

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,119
major corporations

18
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,360
and listed companies from my networks,

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,479
it would be tough for you to secure the

20
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,879
position of the president of the branch.

21
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,440
In this society, effort alone

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,400
and talent aren't enough for success.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,759
You have the talent,

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,319
and I have the connections.

25
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,039
As long as you stay by my side,

26
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,000
you can achieve

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,199
whatever you desire.

28
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,160
I will achieve my goals

29
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,359
on my own.

30
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,199
I don't need anyone's charity.

31
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,759
That was a bold statement.

32
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,400
I can bring these people in

33
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,840
to elevate you to a high position,

34
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,599
but I can also take them away

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
and let you fall to the bottom.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,759
That's what I'm capable of.

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,400
I shouldn't interfere with your choices.

38
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,359
Still, for your information,

39
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,319
Don't get too cocky.

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,199
You know, Yuhui,

41
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,359
those connections of yours

42
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,240
give you an edge; that's for sure.

43
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,680
But I, Ji Yuheng,

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
have come this far

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,199
not because of you

46
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,039
or anyone else.

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,720
I'm not interested in your connections.

48
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,919
Whether you choose to stay or leave,

49
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,720
it's your call.

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,879
As your supervisor,

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
there were things you didn't make public,

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,599
and I merely reminded you

53
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,560
to keep your expectations in check.

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,680
But now, with your

55
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,479
reckless behavior,

56
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,359
I've got no choice but to tell you

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,960
that my team

58
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:38,400
has no place for you.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,240
Nothing can stop me

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,199
from getting what I want,

61
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:51,960
and you are part of that.

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,440
If we were to be together,

63
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,359
I'd be willing to leave Dairui for you.

64
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,799
We're just not right for each other;

65
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,319
and it's impossible for us to be together.

66
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,240
Is it because of Tu Xiaoning?

67
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:08,960
In terms of education,

68
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,039
family background,

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,280
and looks,

70
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,879
what does she have

71
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,960
that could compare to me?

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,919
And after all this time,

73
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,680
I refuse to believe you have

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,160
no feelings for me whatsoever.

75
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,960
The girl who first captured your attention

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
was me.

77
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
Back in college,

78
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,080
at the entrance of the first building,

79
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,200
we met for the very first time.

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,160
The way you looked at me was

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,239
genuinely affectionate and unmistakable.

82
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,239
From that moment on,

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,479
you've held a special place in my heart.

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,479
I knew

85
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,840
you were different from the others.

86
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
You didn't play video games,

87
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,640
you didn't skip classes,

88
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,599
you approach everything

89
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,720
with sincerity.

90
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,760
You're disciplined.

91
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,039
You are exactly the lover I desire.

92
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,359
And after all these years,

93
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,999
we still cross paths.

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,919
You're not married,

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
and I'm still single.

96
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:11,760
Shouldn't we

97
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,400
be together?

98
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,359
Are you finished, my junior?

99
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,400
Honestly, aside from our bond as

100
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,280
senior and junior,

101
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,559
I've never had

102
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,599
any other feelings for you.

103
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,039
Watch out for yourself.

104
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,039
Just because of Tu Xiaoning,

105
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,720
just because she's in the picture,

106
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,919
are you now going to deny

107
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:51,999
everything that happened between us?

108
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,280
Why does everything come to this?

109
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,999
What does she have that's better than me?

110
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,760
Is it because she's opportunistic,

111
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:58,880
she's skilled at maneuvering,

112
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:00,999
and she's attuned to your desires?

113
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,280
Tu Xiaoning,

114
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,160
you've just turned a year older.

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,880
Could you please

116
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,999
stop being so sneaky?

117
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,039
Hiding in the shadows like this,

118
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,960
that was really despicable.

119
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,599
I didn't mean to eavesdrop

120
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:25,640
on your conversation.

121
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:26,880
I was just passing by.

122
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,119
I heard you call my name,

123
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,320
so I came out.

124
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,840
You two are now

125
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,559
officially going public, aren't you?

126
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,479
Aren't you worried I'll head inside

127
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,200
and tell everyone

128
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,760
what your relationship is?

129
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,919
You can do

130
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:17,919
as you wish.

131
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:19,960
But today,

132
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,200
I need to set the record straight.

133
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,520
In my relationship with Tu Xiaoning,

134
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,239
it has never been her

135
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,840
who exploits opportunities

136
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,679
and caters to the other's desires.

137
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,960
It's always been me.

138
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,960
I fell for Tu Xiaoning

139
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,960
at first sight.

140
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:46,999
Let's go.

141
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,039
After all,

142
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:18,720
this is your first birthday

143
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,520
since we got together.

144
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:21,960
It deserves to be celebrated.

145
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,799
You just mentioned

146
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,039
that you fell for me at first sight.

147
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,720
I thought we were together

148
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,280
because we felt

149
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,559
a genuine connection

150
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,760
and decided to pursue a relationship.

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,000
This is quite unexpected.

152
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,719
Long time no see.

153
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,760
Tu Xiaoning.

154
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,120
Is everything you just said true?

155
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,280
How could that possibly be?

156
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,839
What's there to doubt?

157
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,640
I'm a normal guy,

158
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,719
with my own feelings and desires.

159
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,719
Surely I can fall in love at first sight.

160
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:17,280
And you know,

161
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:18,640
I've always been

162
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,400
very meticulous.

163
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:21,640
Marriage is a serious matter;

164
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,319
I wouldn't treat it lightly.

165
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,880
I wanted to register with you

166
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:28,559
because I truly like you.

167
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,120
Then why didn't you

168
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,160
tell me sooner?

169
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,559
I...

170
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,120
I was afraid.

171
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,199
Afraid that at that time,

172
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,760
you wouldn't feel the same way.

173
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,280
The candle is almost burnt out.

174
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,839
Make a wish.

175
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,199
I hope

176
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,160
that every birthday in the future

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,360
will have Ji Yuheng by my side.

♪All the little things about♪

Fanggang.

183
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:38,400
Let's go.

184
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's head back and get another around.

185
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,079
You guys go ahead.

186
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,880
I'm

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,760
still hungry.

188
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,559
I'll keep eating for a bit.

189
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,439
I'll catch up with you guys shortly.

190
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,280
You're such a buzzkill; hurry up!

191
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:46,679
Alright.

192
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,400
Come on.

193
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,919
Hurry, OK?

194
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:48,880
Let's move!

195
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:49,919
Hurry!

196
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,400
Are you alright?

197
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,319
I messed up.

198
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,600
I shouldn't have used water pistol on you.

199
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,559
Look, you've ignored me all day.

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was wrong, seriously.

201
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,919
Don't be mad at me.

202
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,120
You didn't eat

203
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,079
much today.

204
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
Let me get you some lamb.

205
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,919
I'm not eating that.

206
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,360
It's too gamey.

207
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,839
Don't shut me out!

208
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,079
Hey,

209
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,160
you talk too much!

210
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,559
Let me tell you,

211
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,760
I'll settle the score with you later.

212
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,400
I won't be OK unless you

213
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:26,719
settle the score with me later.

214
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,919
What are you...

215
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,319
Why are you back alone?

216
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,959
Where's Mr. Ji?

217
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,039
He probably went back to his room.

218
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,120
Jing,

219
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,799
have a drink with me.

220
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,640
No, I'm good.

221
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,719
I noticed you didn't drink earlier.

222
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,400
What's going on?

223
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you on a sobriety kick?

224
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,760
Blah, blah, blah,

225
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,120
why are you talking so much?

226
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Get out of my face and go to sleep!

227
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:13,959
Get lost!

228
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,760
Aye aye, ma'am!

229
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,240
Did you already know

230
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:37,640
what was going on between

231
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,880
Ji Yuheng and Tu Xiaoning?

232
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,640
The first time we met,

233
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,880
was actually at

234
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,959
an academic building

235
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,880
on campus.

236
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,760
I remember that day,

237
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,679
the weather was particularly nice.

238
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,120
I had just finished classes

239
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,039
and was planning to go with my bestie

240
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,400
to watch a theatrical play

241
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,439
about a romantic story.

242
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,640
Then he suddenly

243
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,760
appeared behind me.

244
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,039
At that moment, I felt

245
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,640
like time had stopped.

246
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,039
It felt like

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,880
the whole world was

248
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,079
just me and him.

249
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,360
So, thinking back,

250
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,400
I guess I fell for him

251
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,280
at first sight.

252
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,039
Then he told me

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,319
he had mistaken me for someone else,

254
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,160
and then he just walked away.

255
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,919
But from that moment on,

256
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,439
I started to notice him.

257
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,319
And I came to know

258
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,199
how exceptional he is.

259
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,079
I remember one year,

260
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,679
during New Year's,

261
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,600
our dorm held a gathering,

262
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
and everyone attended.

263
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,120
Only he stayed behind

264
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,919
in his room to work on his thesis.

265
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,000
Can you even believe that?

266
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,839
Not long after,

267
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,120
he became the first undergraduate student

268
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,640
in his class to publish

269
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,400
as the first author

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,880
in a

271
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,160
core journal.

272
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,520
That's when I realized

273
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,079
this guy

274
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,799
is truly exceptional.

275
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,480
And then, I found

276
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,760
myself falling for him even deeper.

277
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,240
So one time,

278
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
during PE class,

279
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,959
I mustered up my courage

280
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,679
and asked him.

281
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,160
Yuheng,

282
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,160
what kind of girl do you like?

283
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,480
Someone with a high ponytail,

284
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,600
and a cheerful laugh.

285
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,919
Then I thought the girl in our department

286
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,480
who was known for her high ponytail

287
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,600
was none other than me.

288
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,240
So naturally,

289
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,760
I thought he must be talking about me.

290
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,559
I figured he was just

291
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,839
too shy to

292
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,079
express himself.

293
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,799
Then he suddenly

294
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,480
went abroad,

295
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:09,839
and I started working.

296
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,199
We didn't

297
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,760
see each other

298
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:14,799
for a long time.

299
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,520
Until we met again

300
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,039
at Dairui.

301
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:26,480
I...

302
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,520
So later on,

303
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,799
I sometimes found myself wondering,

304
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,240
he's been single for so long,

305
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,360
could it be

306
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
that even a little bit

307
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,880
has something to do with me?

308
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,679
Even if not,

309
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,120
then in terms of romantic relations,

310
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,640
do I have a shot?

311
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,760
It's actually ridiculous, you know?

312
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,600
I have actually

313
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,839
trapped myself.

314
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
I've confined myself

315
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:07,719
to the fleeting glance

316
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,679
I had of him during my student days.

317
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
This isn't affection,

318
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,360
but an obsession.

319
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,479
Come on,

320
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,040
Tang Yuhui,

321
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,199
it's been so long already.

322
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,040
Time to wake up.

323
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,519
Tang Yuhui,

324
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,479
you're an outstanding girl.

325
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,199
It's just relationships;

326
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,679
why trap yourself?

327
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,679
Take care of yourself.

328
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,479
You're awake.

329
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:37,999
I brought you some breakfast.

330
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,160
What is this?

331
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,199
A birthday gift for you.

332
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,360
Do you like it?

333
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,640
I love it.

334
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,560
I also got you a gift.

335
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:57,360
Look!

336
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:01,999
It's exactly the same!

337
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,840
Why did you want to

338
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
give me a gift all of a sudden?

339
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,080
Mr. Zhao said

340
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:14,439
a man should have a decent watch.

341
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,840
I've been managing our income for so long

342
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,759
and haven't bought you anything.

343
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,759
So I thought,

344
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,160
taking this opportunity,

345
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,400
I'd buy you a watch.

346
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,800
And our tastes

347
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,239
are exactly the same!

348
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,279
Matching couple watches.

349
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,919
Matching couple watches.

350
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,679
Aren't they too similar?

351
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:42,719
They're obviously matching ones.

352
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,439
Then how can we

353
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
wear them together?

354
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:47,959
Well,

355
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,959
how about this:

356
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,239
you wear yours most of the time,

357
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,679
and I'll find chances

358
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,679
to wear mine secretly.

359
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:58,880
How does that sound?

360
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:17,880
You are the boss.

361
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,600
Why are you smiling?

362
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,320
I just remembered

363
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,279
the first time I rode in your car,

364
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,759
you played the same song.

365
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,239
So you've been having

366
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,160
feelings for me since then?

367
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,600
Nice acting, Mr. Ji.

368
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,759
I couldn't tell at all.

369
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,080
Congratulations.

370
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:01,959
You've landed

371
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,320
such a big project like Weiji.

372
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,360
Regarding our earnout agreement,

373
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,160
we should have already doubled the

374
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,439
performance of our team by now, right?

375
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,719
How do you know?

376
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,199
Did you calculate it in secret?

377
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah, I did.

378
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,080
The Weiji deal

379
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:17,999
plus the 800 million deposits

380
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,880
from the government,

381
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,400
let alone doubling,

382
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,080
it could even triple!

383
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,320
There are still five months left

384
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,400
until our agreement ends.

385
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,479
I haven't even achieved

386
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,479
half of my 50 million goal.

387
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Do you need any help?

388
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:36,400
No, I'm good.

389
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:38,840
I can handle it myself.

390
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,840
Every bit of my performance

391
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,959
needs to be earned fairly and squarely.

392
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,080
I can do it myself.

393
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,400
Alright, Ms. Tu,

394
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,120
we've arrived at your destination.

395
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,800
I wish you all the best

396
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,519
with this project.

397
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:57,759
Thank you, Mr. Ji,

398
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,279
for being my chauffeur.

399
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:00,999
I'm going in.

400
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,759
Go get them.

401
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:14,999
Xiaoning!

402
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,640
What's wrong?

403
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:28,479
Good luck!

404
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,560
Go for it!

405
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,519
I'm going!

406
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:43,959
So, you've made up your mind.

407
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,479
Yes.

408
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,640
It's been a pleasure working with you.

409
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,479
I wish you all the best in the future.

410
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,800
That should be

411
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,880
my wish for you.

412
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,040
After all, once I leave here,

413
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,840
the future looks promising for me.

414
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,120
But you'll face

415
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:04,999
quite a few challenges.

416
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,080
I still need to thank you for

417
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:10,320
keeping my relationship

418
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:11,519
with Xiaoning a secret.

419
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,320
Secrets always

420
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,080
come out in the end.

421
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,919
Anyway, your relationship

422
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,239
will eventually be found out.

423
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,279
Why should I be the bad guy?

424
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,400
We should avoid embarrassing ourselves.

425
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,400
We might still have the opportunity

426
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,560
to work together in the future.

427
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:27,880
Looking forward to it.

428
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,560
Yuheng,

429
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,199
ten years ago,

430
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,719
when you stopped me

431
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,199
at the entrance of the first building,

432
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,880
were you trying to get to know me, or

433
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,800
did you really mistake me for someone else?

434
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,120
Back then,

435
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,360
you had a high ponytail,

436
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,560
and from behind,

437
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,360
you looked a lot like the girl

438
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,239
I liked in high school.

439
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,560
So that girl was...

440
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,120
Tu Xiaoning.

441
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,040
So you've liked

442
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,160
her since...

443
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,439
I started liking her

444
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,040
back in high school.

445
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,040
All these years, it's always been her.

446
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,400
Only her.

447
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,080
It seems that

448
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,999
since I first met you,

449
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,040
I've already lost my shot.

450
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:13,959
As I thought,

451
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,279
it wasn't my problem.

452
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,679
It's a shame

453
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,360
that I can't be

454
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,279
with my "Mr. Ideal."

455
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,479
I wish you

456
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,880
all the best.

457
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:24,959
Thank you.

458
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,160
Actually, I'm not much different from you.

459
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,519
I'm just a bit luckier.

460
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,279
I got a second chance

461
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,840
to be with the one I love.

462
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:43,320
Xiaoning,

463
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,679
I must get promoted to the president.

464
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,199
To give our relationship

465
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,640
more confidence

466
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,880
and a backup plan.

467
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,479
If in the end,

468
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,959
I don't want this child,

469
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,439
he'll probably come to haunt me.

470
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,199
It's already 21 million.

471
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,160
There's still 29 million left.

472
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,400
I'll work harder.

473
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,640
With a bit of luck,

474
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
there's hope.

475
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,279
Why are you

476
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,279
still working?

477
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,400
Hey, I'm...

478
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:08,999
Hey, don't touch my desktop.

479
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,640
I'm revising the contract!

480
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:11,080
Look at this.

481
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,239
Dairui's heartthrob, Ji Yuheng,

482
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,160
who will he end up with?

483
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:17,080
Xiaoning,

484
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,400
come on!

485
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:19,959
Reading gossips at work

486
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:20,560
in the morning...

487
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,400
Check this out!

488
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,320
That's huge!

489
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,439
Who is it?

490
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:29,999
The boss's girlfriend.

491
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:31,360
You idiot!

492
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,800
Xiaoning was asking,

493
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,519
who the boss' girlfriend is.

494
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,600
How would I know?

495
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:36,479
You stupid...

496
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:38,679
But according to what it says here,

497
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,120
they were really

498
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,040
hugging each other.

499
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,120
So sweet!

500
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,160
In a trench coat.

501
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,880
Has class? Of course!

502
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,040
Our boss has great taste.

503
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,600
Of course.

504
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,560
Sometimes,

505
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,279
you can't believe

506
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,040
everything you read on the internet.

507
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,400
Look, it's all clear here.

508
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,479
It's not a celebrity or an internet star.

509
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:58,479
Enough, enough.

510
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,160
Stop gossiping.

511
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,719
Go back to your work!

512
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,400
Miss Rao,

513
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,199
I was...

514
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,199
What's the hurry?

515
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,120
Eh,

516
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,640
look,

517
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,560
this contract...

518
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,439
There was a post online,

519
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:14,640
saying that

520
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:16,120
there was a mysterious girl...

521
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,840
Did you see the post online?

522
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,800
Someone saw us hugging.

523
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,400
Don't worry.

524
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,279
The one who posted it only saw from afar

525
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,360
that you were wearing a trench coat,

526
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,080
but they didn't see your face,

527
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:29,479
nor did they take a photo.

528
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,160
Good then.

529
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,640
Where is Yuhui?

530
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,919
She still hasn't shown up yet.

531
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:44,239
Fanggang,

532
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,080
come here for a moment.

533
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:47,120
Okay.

534
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,239
I'll go sound it out for you.

535
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,120
Do you think

536
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,239
this mysterious woman

537
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,239
might be Yuhui?

538
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:02,719
Has class,

539
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,560
wears a trench coat.

540
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,560
Doesn't Yuhui wear a trench coat?

541
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,400
Plus, yesterday,

542
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,479
Fanggang went over it with me.

543
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,199
I'll go back to work then.

544
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,840
Enough.

545
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,759
Stop gossiping.

546
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,999
The boss said that

547
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,080
it was his fiancé.

548
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,080
His fiancé?

549
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,279
The boss has a fiancé?

550
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,640
Mr. Ji has a fiancé!

551
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:26,640
What?

552
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,719
When did this happen?

553
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,239
Why haven't I heard about it?

554
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,600
My goodness!

555
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,120
You work with

556
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,719
Mr. Ji everyday.

557
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,080
And now, suddenly he's got

558
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,439
this flashy girlfriend,

559
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,719
you've never heard anything?

560
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:39,999
No.

561
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,840
Our boss is really good at

562
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:42,800
keeping it a secret.

563
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,080
And they never call

564
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,320
or text each other?

565
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,320
If this girl drops her boyfriend off

566
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,919
at work this early in the morning,

567
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,919
they must be very clingy with each other.

568
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,439
What boyfriend?

569
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,600
He's her fiancé.

570
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,999
Right, right, right.

571
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,880
Her fiancé.

572
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,600
She's dropping her fiancé off at work.

573
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,959
Maybe this woman

574
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,239
works in this very building!

575
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,160
Maybe it's the one

576
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,080
who works in food and beverage marketing.

577
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,919
Or the doctor from that

578
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,199
newly opened stomatology hospital.

579
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,719
I don't think it's neither of them.

580
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,600
The enemy

581
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,640
is within.

582
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,519
I've long heard about him and Tang Yuhui,

583
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,400
the one that just got transferred.

584
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,160
They studied together in university.

585
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,320
Maybe they've been together for a while.

586
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,840
Don't talk nonsense.

587
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:27,999
There's nothing

588
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,880
between our boss and Tang Yuhui.

589
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,759
Don't spread such rumors.

590
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,199
Not necessarily.

591
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,840
If there's truly nothing,

592
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,120
why did Yuhui leave?

593
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:38,120
Don't spread such rumors.

594
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,279
Xiaoning.

595
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,040
Xiaoning, this is the second floor.

596
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,640
We're not arrived yet.

597
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:45,840
Have a glass of milk.

598
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,239
Why did you tell Fanggang

599
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,479
that you were engaged?

600
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,600
Now

601
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,479
they're all talking

602
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,279
about this.

603
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:56,279
Instead of letting them gossip,

604
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:56,999
we might as well

605
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:58,320
just admit it openly.

606
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,759
There will be less such comments

607
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,439
in the future this way.

608
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,679
But,

609
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,239
everyone is very curious now.

610
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,040
What if they find out?

611
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,160
Okay now,

612
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,040
don't worry.

613
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,439
The bank doesn't survive

614
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,160
on gossip and rumors.

615
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,439
We're all busy with work.

616
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,279
Who's really

617
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,519
got the time to

618
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,360
watch my every move 24/7?

619
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,160
It'll be fine once it blows over.

620
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,199
Today was my fault.

621
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,479
What do we do in the future?

622
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,040
I, I shouldn't have

623
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:28,080
let myself go and hugged you.

624
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,239
I should have held it back.

625
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:30,880
From now on,

626
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,080
I can't use the hair tie anymore,

627
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,120
nor can I wear the trench coat.

628
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,120
Most importantly,

629
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,959
I just bought that trench coat today!

630
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,719
Isn't that perfect then?

631
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,439
You can buy some more

632
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,439
with this opportunity.

633
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:39,560
No.

634
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,199
I thought that

635
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,800
with Tang Yuhui gone,

636
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,479
we have defused a ticking time bomb.

637
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,279
Who would have thought that

638
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,719
she was not the real threat.

639
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,959
How did it go with the Jian Branch?

640
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,279
Could you get

641
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:54,959
the president position?

642
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,800
I thought since I got the Weiji Group,

643
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
it would have been a sure thing.

644
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,759
But unexpectedly,

645
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,360
a few candidates came back from abroad.

646
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:03,600
They say their qualifications

647
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,519
and abilities are quite impressive.

648
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,999
I guess the head office leaders

649
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,679
would probably want to

650
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,759
take a comprehensive look at all options

651
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,080
before making

652
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,919
the best choice.

653
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,239
Now it's the time for us

654
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,719
to be extra careful.

655
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
In our bank,

656
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,560
office romances are definitely

657
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,679
not something that

658
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,560
should be brought into the open.

659
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,080
So,

660
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,160
if they find out about us,

661
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,080
it could affect

662
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,320
the leaders' judgement of you.

663
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,519
We can't let them find out about us,

664
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,439
especially not now.

665
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,320
Especially with things like this,

666
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,640
once one person finds out,

667
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:35,719
it will spread quickly,

668
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,439
and soon everyone will know.

669
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,360
Here's what we'll do.

670
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,320
From tomorrow,

671
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,519
I'll take the subway to work.

672
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:45,640
And

673
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,320
in the office, if there's no work-related

674
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,600
issues, I will leave you alone.

675
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,080
We'll see after this period.

676
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,759
Okay.

677
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,400
However,

678
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:56,360
you don't have to

679
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,439
feel this much pressure.

680
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,840
No matter what

681
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
bad situation arises,

682
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:01,759
I have a solution for it.

683
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,400
What solution?

684
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,279
It's still better if they don't find out.

685
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:06,880
Okay.

686
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,640
I'll listen to you.

687
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,279
Why aren't you speaking to me?

688
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,640
Say something, please.

689
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:14,640
I don't want to talk today.

690
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,439
Go back to your place.

691
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,239
I'm not going.

692
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,759
Didn't we say at the resort that

693
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,880
we'll settle the score after we get back?

694
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,519
We're not doing that anymore?

695
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm not in the mood, forget it.

696
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,840
Wait,

697
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,279
what happened exactly?

698
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,239
Why are you sticking to me

699
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,479
like a piece of gum

700
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:28,080
that I can't shake off?

701
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,360
My chance of being alone

702
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
with my girlfriend can't just

703
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,719
be taken away without any reasons.

704
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,959
Sticking?

705
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,400
That's the first step.

706
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,120
Tell me,

707
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,919
what's going on with you?

708
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,360
Why aren't you talking to me

709
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,320
all of a sudden?

710
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:44,479
How annoying you are!

711
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:45,160
Sometimes I just

712
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,919
want to be alone, is that not allowed?

713
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:50,080
Sure.

714
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,560
Giving each other

715
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,880
some personal space sometimes

716
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,199
can help the relationship.

717
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:55,999
I understand.

718
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,040
But,

719
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:58,880
you still

720
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,999
need to eat.

721
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:00,919
Or

722
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:01,600
it's not good to your stomach.

723
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,320
I made your favorite, stir fried noodles

724
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,519
with shredded pork and egg.

725
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,840
Here.

726
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:21,040
If he were to be a father,

727
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:22,239
he probably

728
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:22,880
would be

729
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,519
a responsible and great one.

730
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,040
Give it.

731
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,279
Slow down.

732
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:55,879
You're laughing!

733
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,080
You're happy now?

734
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:06,520
Actually,

735
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,319
today I...

736
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:08,160
As long as you're happy.

737
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,199
I was really frustrated.

738
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:11,679
Who do you think

739
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,719
Yuheng's fiancé

740
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,640
really is?

741
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,560
Half a day later

742
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,440
you're still thinking about this?

743
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,560
So mysterious.

744
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,960
I'm so curious!

745
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,920
But I've already had it figured out.

746
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,480
Next time

747
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,080
when I'm at a dinner party with Yuheng,

748
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
I'll take him home

749
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,719
when he's drunk.

750
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:29,640
This way,

751
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,440
I can see

752
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,319
who she really is.

753
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,080
What do you think?

754
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:32,960
Am I smart or what?

755
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,160
Smart. Just don't be

756
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,120
too surprised when that happens.

757
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,879
Not possible.

758
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,279
Next week?

759
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:38,839
No, not next week.

760
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:40,239
The week after that.

761
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,160
That week the park is looking for investments,

762
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:42,879
there'll definitely be a dinner party.

763
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:43,640
Why don't you have a bite too,

764
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,960
and shut your mouth!

765
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:46,399
I made this for you!

766
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,920
Why did you leave?

767
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,719
Wait for me!

768
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,080
Seducing someone's husband

769
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,960
this shamelessly.

770
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Do you dare to show your face?

771
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,080
Come out!

772
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,560
And let all your colleagues see

773
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,239
what kind of person you really are!

774
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,040
Is it you?

775
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:03,960
Is it you

776
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
who seduced my husband?

777
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,520
What's happening?

778
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,279
Who is it?

779
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:06,799
Section two's

780
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:08,120
-Is it you? -Mr. Xing's wife,

781
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,239
said someone's having an affair

782
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,960
with Mr. Xing in the office.

783
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,000
She's here to catch them!

784
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,279
And Mr. Xing?

785
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:15,120
Why isn't he here?

786
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:16,480
What if the situations escalates?

787
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,560
Mr. Xing must be hiding far away.

788
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,719
Who dares to come out

789
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,000
and confront directly in this situation?

790
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,160
Bastard!

791
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,000
Is it you

792
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,920
who seduced Mr. Xing?

793
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:33,799
Is it you?

794
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:36,199
Did you seduce my husband?

795
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,160
No, no, no.

796
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,719
Is it you?

797
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,399
Then do you know who it was?

798
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,279
Who is it? What?

799
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,359
No one would say anything?

800
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,520
Did you seduce my husband?

801
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,480
What's happening?

802
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,160
This early in the morning,

803
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,719
it's like a market here.

804
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,879
Section Two's Mr. Xing's wife.

805
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:52,279
Mr. Xing's wife?

806
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:54,920
I understand.

807
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,000
Eh, excuse me.

808
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,520
It's work hours now,

809
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,879
can't you not...

810
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,080
I know.

811
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,879
Look at how you're dressed.

812
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:06,879
You must be a slut!

813
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:07,679
It must have been you

814
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,920
who seduced Mr. Xing!

815
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,239
Are you sure I

816
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,359
seduced Mr. Xing?

817
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,560
Look at you,

818
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,600
dressed that slutty for work!

819
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:16,600
You don't look like a decent woman at all!

820
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,040
You're the decent one then.

821
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,279
Calling someone a slut

822
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,480
randomly

823
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,399
in front of our company

824
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:22,480
this early in the morning,

825
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,799
are you a decent person?

826
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,759
Who are you calling indecent?

827
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:25,279
What do you want?

828
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:25,960
Who are you calling indecent?

829
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,319
Who are you calling indecent?

830
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:28,799
Let go!

831
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:29,319
Let go!

832
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:30,799
I already called the police!

833
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,080
Let go!

834
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,520
Let go!

835
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:34,960
Who are you calling indecent?

836
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,960
Let go!

837
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,279
He's hitting me! He's hitting me!

838
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:43,799
I see now!

839
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,440
You two are having an affair!

840
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,920
Did you all see?

841
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:48,000
Did you see?

842
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,319
It's this woman!

843
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,799
Texting my husband

844
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,440
in the middle of the night everyday!

845
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,719
Talking about love and stuff!

846
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,679
All those shameless words!

847
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,279
Shut up!

848
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:56,359
What are you talking about?

849
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,600
Why would I shut up?

850
00:37:57,799 --> 00:37:58,560
Isn't she dressed like that

851
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,759
to seduce men?

852
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,719
You only like other people's men, huh?

853
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,440
Do other people's men

854
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,480
spend money on you?

855
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,560
Without men

856
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,600
you can't live anymore, is that it?

857
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,719
She's free

858
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:07,520
to dress however she wants!

859
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,600
It has nothing to do with you!

860
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,839
It's not wrong for anyone

861
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,879
to show off their beauty.

862
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,520
You

863
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,640
have no right to slander her!

864
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,359
All these years

865
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,520
she's been working so hard.

866
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,719
She's as good as anyone else!

867
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,040
Certainly better than your husband!

868
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,080
She has had plenty of

869
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:19,719
wealthy and influential clients,

870
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,440
but she's always been very professional.

871
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,279
She has never had any

872
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,199
inappropriate relationships with anyone!

873
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,199
And she'd never be into your husband!

874
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:25,960
Moreover,

875
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:27,560
she can't live without men?

876
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,480
She's been living on her own independently

877
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:30,799
all these years

878
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,319
and has taken good care of herself.

879
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,279
It's not your place

880
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,120
to judge her here.

881
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:35,679
You listen up,

882
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,960
from now on,

883
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,440
if you insult her

884
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,480
even once,

885
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,000
I'll start recording

886
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,920
and then call the police.

887
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,160
Did you hear me?

888
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,879
Did you hear me?

889
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,000
You know her pretty well.

890
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,199
What,

891
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,480
are you her man?

892
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,080
Yes,

893
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,839
I'm her boyfriend.

894
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,359
The bank knows

895
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,839
about you and Jing.

896
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,239
One of you

897
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,199
has to be transferred.

898
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,679
I've thought about it carefully.

899
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,920
I won't get transferred.

900
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,920
If I get transferred to another city,

901
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,359
Jing will be here

902
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,520
all alone.

903
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:35,440
I'd rather quit.

904
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,560
What are your plans

905
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,319
with Miss Rao for the future?

906
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,520
I'm not sure

907
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,719
about her,

908
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,120
but I definitely won't let go.

909
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:55,759
It's okay.

910
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,319
You don't need to worry.

911
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,239
I'll keep an eye for you

912
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,640
and see if there's

913
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,679
any suitable job for you in the city.

914
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:06,399
Jing,

915
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,359
the boyfriend you were talking about

916
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,759
before was Fanggang?

917
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,120
Fanggang's girlfriend

918
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,199
is actually Jing!

919
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,160
If they two get together,

920
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,319
wouldn't they fight

921
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:26,120
all the time?

922
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,199
Behind all the conflicts,

923
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:29,520
it's all love.

924
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:35,679
Let's go.

925
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,279
Let's get some air.

926
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,359
All these dramas this early in the morning

927
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,160
is making me nauseous.

928
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,679
I want to throw up.

929
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,600
Wait, Jing.

930
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,759
Your stomach is always upset

931
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:51,879
recently.

932
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,560
It's still uncertain

933
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,520
for you and Fanggang.

934
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,480
Let's put it aside for now.

935
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,000
Let me go with you to the hospital.

936
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,080
Let's go do a check-up.

937
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:00,279
It's not okay if your stomach's always upset.

938
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,480
Stop looking.

939
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,120
I'm not carrying Nezha.

940
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,960
It's not been long, it doesn't show yet.

941
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,520
*Nezha is a deity in Chinese folklore, his mom carried him for 3 and a half years.

942
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,679
Still looking.

943
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:28,319
It really doesn't show yet.

944
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:29,199
I,

945
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,120
I'm just happy for you.

946
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:32,000
And Fanggang?

947
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:33,080
He must be really happy.

948
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,440
I didn't tell him.

949
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:36,920
Why?

950
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,319
These

951
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,640
are the information about my clients.

952
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:50,560
After I'm gone,

953
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,120
they're all yours.

954
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,600
These all belong to

955
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:57,920
Section One.

956
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,000
If I bring them with me,

957
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,839
it wouldn't be right to Yuheng.

958
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,080
You're quitting?

959
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,000
Everyone knows about us now,

960
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,640
one of us has to be transferred.

961
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,120
I've seen enough

962
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,679
discrimination against women

963
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:23,920
in the workplace these years.

964
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:27,399
If we start all over again

965
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,399
at your age,

966
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,719
other banks

967
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,600
will surely

968
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
give you problems about

969
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,839
marriage and having kids.

970
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:35,480
So you can't be transferred.

971
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,239
Plus when I pursued you,

972
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,160
I've already thought it through.

973
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,080
If someday

974
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,199
they found out about us,

975
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,199
and I broke up with you,

976
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,600
or

977
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:49,879
be a coward,

978
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:52,440
I'm not a real man.

979
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,359
I should just leave you in peace then.

980
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,080
They wanna transfer me to another city,

981
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,640
but I don't want you to be alone.

982
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,239
I'd rather quit.

983
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,120
What?

984
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:25,080
There's something I didn't tell you.

985
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,120
I'm pregnant.

986
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,040
Why are you still up?

987
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,160
I'm turning off the light.

988
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,279
Go back to sleep now.
