1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,040
Remember to save the circuit maintenance file at 9 o'clock tonight

2
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,880
Thanks

3
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,280
Did you kiss last night

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,760
You see the way she came out of his house

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm drunk. I must have kissed

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,920
Maybe

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,520
Why do you have to kiss when you drink too much?

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,640
You can control yourself if you drink too much, okay

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,800
Did you see last night's update, too

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
We're talking about last night's update

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,840
The days of living with the boss

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,080
Isn't that what you said

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,920
Yes

14
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,760
Hello

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,040
All right, team leader. I'll be right up

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,560
That one last night

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,440
How dare you say last night

18
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
It can't really be

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,280
You don't remember

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,800
Is it too much

21
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,200
You don't think you can default on your debts by fragments

22
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,120
Be responsible for what

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,320
Everyone is an adult

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,800
What's the responsibility for kissing

25
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,480
Job number 0079 What are you talking about

26
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,320
I'm talking about my car wash last night

27
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,880
Are you not going to be responsible

28
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,880
Brother

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,080
These projects are prepared to be promoted by the company at the meeting

30
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,560
At the board meeting in 2 months

31
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,480
It is estimated that Liu Dong will talk about your project and experience

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,840
Thank you, brother. It's so kind to me

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,720
But

34
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,920
I went back to China this time because I was optimistic about a project

35
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
Decided to push it forward

36
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,840
I also like this project very much

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,080
It was developed by a man named Wang Wei

39
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,480
This boy is quite talented

40
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,160
I guess he is not the talented one

41
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,600
Our company

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,040
No need

43
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,000
A person who takes credit for other people's works

44
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,680
You won't have to come again

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Go to the finance department to sign and claim the compensation

46
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,960
Hey, hey, help. Come and block it. Hey, me

47
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,920
I'll go

48
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,680
Would you

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Waiting for me to drink plenty of water

50
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,720
Ouch, what meat shall I cut? You cut the back row

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,640
Do you see how the assassin across the street cut it

52
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,840
Why do you play in a group

53
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,880
My big lady

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,960
Are you lying to your wife that you are not at home again

55
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,160
I went on a date

56
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
What's the matter

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,000
My mother is coming to our house

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
Butler's supplement: My wife found out that Xu's son is still in the company

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,680
Butler's supplement: I thought you accompanied him to work overtime to Wonderland culture

60
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
Waiting, waiting, coming right away

61
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,440
Yulu OS: I won't do it for my boss

62
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,520
Yulu OS: I won't do it for my boss
