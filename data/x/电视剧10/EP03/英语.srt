1
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,880
Grandma

2
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,840
Miss Jiang is really a rumored symbol

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Do you still adapt after returning home

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
Is there anything we can do for you

5
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
You can talk to Xiaofeng

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
There is really a grandmother. Since she doesn't treat me like an outsider,

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,840
Then I'll be straight with it

8
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,400
Okay, you tell me quickly

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,440
There is nothing else

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,400
Is our Wonderland culture

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,560
It is said that it is the most concerned employee in the industry

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,480
It is also an enterprise that advocates hierarchical management

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,960
So I suggest

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,640
Our annual leave can be increased to one month

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,240
Then give some shuttle buses to employees who live far away

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,360
Besides, the ladies' room in our company is always in line

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,720
There are no people in the men's room

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,480
Can you add a little more ladies' room

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,440
Oops

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,640
Am I saying too much

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
Miss Jiang, it seems

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,440
You are quite familiar with our company

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,360
Show her around

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
Thank you, Miss Jiang, for your concern

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,920
Should

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,800
Fast Southern Wind

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,360
Have you written down everything Miss Jiang said just now

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,800
If it can't be solved well, I'll settle accounts with you

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,840
Miss Jiang's dish today

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,440
They are all specially prepared according to your preferences

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Your uncle Liu also specially asked for us

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,360
Come and try it

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,360
How could I forget

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,440
Xizhou loves to eat this kind of thing that can kill me in one bite

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,360
It's a big deal to go to the hospital

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,720
Xiaofeng, pay attention

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,400
The waiter changed the plate

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,720
Give him a new suit

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,440
I usually drop a drop of oil on my body

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,800
People who need to take three baths

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
Why are you so careless today

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,320
How do you know

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't thank the money for clothes. Let the finance deduct it from your salary

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,920
I am very happy today

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,280
Everybody raise your glasses

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,440
I hope our Xu family will have many happy events this year

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,400
Everybody drink

48
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
Xi Zhou is old enough to drink. I have to maintain her personnel

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,840
Afflictive

50
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,440
Elder sister

51
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,520
Thanks to you, it's only 200 meters away from the hotel now

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,400
Dude, it's okay

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,800
You drive yours

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,600
I threw up when I opened the window

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,880
You still feel proud, don't you

56
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,200
Now get off and take a taxi back

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,400
Drive

58
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
I'm telling you

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
You mustn't bully Jiang Xizhou

60
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,320
She's the best

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,840
I bullied her

62
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,600
It's right for me to bully you

63
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Right

64
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,920
You're bullying me

65
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,360
Why are you looking for a cell phone

66
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
I want to ask my boss for leave

67
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,200
I am your boss

68
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
Boss

69
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
I would like to take a leave of absence

70
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
Sure

71
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,720
Then you beg me
