1
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,600
Xiaofeng

2
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,760
Let you sit in this position

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,720
It is we who give Lao Xu a face

4
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,160
You do things like this

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,440
It makes it difficult for me

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
I'm already investigating

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,480
I can assure you

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,800
This plan must belong to our company

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,600
I won't make it difficult for our company

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,920
No, someone has already taken care of the other company

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
And after our board of directors studied it,

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,520
He is better suited to sit in this position than you are

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
Xiaofeng, we are not forcing you

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,520
But I hope you

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,320
Make a good decision for everyone by yourself

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,880
Someone took care of the other company

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,720
But her designs are all in the company's encrypted data

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,600
These are her painstaking efforts and belong to her

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,840
You sign this

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,440
I'll help you settle all this down

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,480
Nanfeng

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,760
It is also a child I brought up since I was a child

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,880
Why would he do this to us

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,840
Xiaofeng

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,760
Ever since you were removed from the board of directors,

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,680
The only one who can help us now is the Chen family

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,360
This is the last hope of our Xu family

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,120
You can't be willful any longer

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,360
Why

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,560
Do you remember

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
Did I tell you about the car accident

32
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,160
I thought you said

33
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
Was that an accident

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,040
Since it was an accident,

35
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,440
Why don't you show me the accident replay

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920
Why shattered glass

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,160
But they also adopted you

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,640
How could it hurt your father

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
Then why is only my dad dead

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,600
My world has collapsed

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,040
They sneezed like they did

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,080
Besides, they adopted me

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
It's just for business image

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
From small to large

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm just a tool man for my brother's feet

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,880
But you still call him brother

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
It's just a habit

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
So

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,120
All of it

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,360
It's all fake, isn't it

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,840
To you

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,720
No

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,040
Actually, I have something to say to you today

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,680
I have something to say to you, too

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Ah

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,880
Listen to the opinions of the directors

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,520
Now the other company has something on us

58
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
Even bear legal responsibility

59
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,640
Xiaofeng

60
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,640
You have to shoulder the heavy responsibility at this critical moment

61
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,400
It is also an explanation for these antiques

62
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,240
Everyone said, right

63
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,400
Members of the Directors

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,160
This is

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,640
All drafts of design scheme and design process

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,720
And the proofreading time of each edition

67
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,640
With this evidence,

68
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,600
Who did what behind his back

69
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,600
I believe the relevant departments will find out soon

70
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,240
What's going on here

71
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,000
It's too late to explain

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
He needs your help

73
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,760
My family can only help drag it off for a while

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,400
I thought this manuscript was damaged

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,240
Actually, it was transferred

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,080
This man is

77
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,560
Who is this man

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,440
I believe Mr. Xu will find out

79
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,520
Give the directors an account

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,280
Telephone supplement: Didn't you say that the Xu family is foolproof

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,200
Telephone supplement: Now we are the defendant's side instead

82
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
Telephone supplement: I tell you I'm not finished with you about this

83
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm sorry

84
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
You don't hate me

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,360
Do you know why I chose to return home to inherit my family property

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
It's not because I can't get along outside

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
I can only go home and inherit hundreds of millions of possessions

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,320
Because when I was little, someone told me

89
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,920
Will always support me to realize my dream

90
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,720
Thank you for coming back.

91
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,360
Are you still leaving

92
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,840
Hello

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,120
What happened to my mother

94
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,760
Now

95
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,280
But it will take me three hours to get back at the earliest

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,080
Okay, I'll find a way. Don't worry

97
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,680
3 hours
