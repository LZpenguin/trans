1
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,720
Waiter

2
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
Brother lend me five minutes to be a boyfriend

3
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,480
You are I am

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,040
This is my boyfriend next to me

5
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,960
I'm here today to promise the middleman

6
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,360
Give two families a face

7
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,720
But wait a minute. I'll tell the middleman

8
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,800
Don't introduce this rubbish to me in the future

9
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,120
Who are you calling trash

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,520
What are you doing

11
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
What did I do? I know you

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,080
Find this person to pay for your mobile phone after going out

13
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,800
But do this kind of thing later

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,520
It's not as simple as making a mobile phone

15
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,760
Do you hear me

16
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,280
Master Xu

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,160
Master Xu

18
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,320
Are you mistaken for someone else

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,960
He's not Hsu Chin-feng

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,440
Miss Chiang

21
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,080
Nice to meet you

22
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Miss Jiang Da

23
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,080
Forget if you think I'm so ugly in your heart

24
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,600
Do you think we

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,280
Will the Xu family let the big lady sit in the hall for a blind date

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,360
You have to speak two minutes later

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,640
Forget the lobby

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,440
I can dig out three rooms and one living room for you

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
Nothing, nothing

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,760
I mean

31
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,520
Master Xu, this meal is too insincere, isn't it

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,040
This seafood is not fresh

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,320
Since Miss Jiang doesn't like it, let's pour it down

34
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,200
Don't

35
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,000
I mean, it wouldn't be so wasteful

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
You can eat if you make do

37
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,800
Since Miss Jiang doesn't like it, change another batch

38
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,800
Then I'm not welcome

39
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,520
I thought she said she was spoiled

40
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,560
What happened

41
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,520
It looks good

42
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,200
This is the last piece

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,440
I don't want to divide you a little

44
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,080
Not interested

45
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,200
It doesn't work well

46
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,840
Do it again somewhere else

47
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,840
If you eat too much, go out and find a place to visit

48
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,240
What is the most expensive bag in your shop

49
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,280
The money was flown in from the show two hours ago

50
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,920
You are a friend of our general manager Xu

51
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,680
Naturally, the VIP price is also 800,000

52
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
Isn't it good to meet Miss Jiang for the first time

53
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,480
Make it look like our Xu family

54
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,800
It's like taking 800,000 bags to deal with you

55
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,440
How do you do the high-definition that you bought in the show factory today

56
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,640
Pack all clothes and bags

57
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,720
Send it to Miss Jiang's house

58
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,520
OK

59
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,360
It seems that Miss Jiang today

60
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,080
I have to think a little more about the reasons for rejecting people

61
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,960
But it doesn't matter if you can't think of it

62
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
Looking forward to seeing you next time

63
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
Find this pair of shoes to Miss Jiang's size

64
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Get married together

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,880
It is estimated that Miss Lin will take 40 minutes to drive to your company

66
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,920
Get in the car and I'll see you off

67
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
Auntie, you have a conscience
