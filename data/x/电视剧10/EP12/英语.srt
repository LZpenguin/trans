00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,840
Mom

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,360
Hey, rain and dew, why are you back

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,400
My aunt said you were dying

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,280
Ah, your aunt got the wrong report

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,360
It's okay. It's okay. Are you tired of coming back all the way

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,320
Actually, someone sent it back by helicopter

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,960
He

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,040
Your boyfriend

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,960
Ah

00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,360
Come here

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,000
How do you do, aunt

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,960
My name is Xu Jinfeng

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,160
Please call me Xiao Xu

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,640
Hello, aunt

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,520
This lady, my car broke down

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,360
Can I rub your car down the hill

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,320
Don't use this lame interface I used, okay

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,160
What about this

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,240
I lost my car keys

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,320
Hey

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,240
Hey

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,160
How do you know

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,800
I liked this one best when I was at school

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,040
Then look at it

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,720
Our company's induction readiness is no joke

27
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,160
Actually, I am today

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
I have something to say to you

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,760
Marry me

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:52,320
Marry him, marry him, marry him, marry him

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,280
Marry him, marry him, marry him, marry him

32
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,760
Marry him, marry him, marry him, marry him

33
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,520
Marry him, marry him

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,960
Let's go play that

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,800
Sure, would you like a bottle

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,880
Thanks

37
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,720
It's for me

38
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,720
Thanks

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
You

40
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,760
It's not hot

41
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
What are you doing

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Hard work

43
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
I'm afraid you don't want to see me

44
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,520
Who says I don't want to see you

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,600
Come on, debriefing

46
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,160
Remember to invite us to dinner if you succeed in promotion

47
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,880
Refueling

48
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,560
My next plan for my work is

49
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Miss Lam Yuk-lok

50
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,760
Will you marry me

51
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,480
Boss

52
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,960
Oh, no. Did I succeed in this job

53
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,600
Say yes quickly

54
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,320
Don't promise again

55
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm going to rush to answer

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Boss

57
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
I will

58
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,880
Also called the boss

59
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,640
Husband

60
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,560
Husband
