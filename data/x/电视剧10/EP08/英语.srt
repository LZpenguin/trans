1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,040
Good boss

2
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,600
You go first. I'll go to the bathroom

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,160
Good

4
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,640
What's wrong with defaulting again

5
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,480
This is a company

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,360
What's the matter

7
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,280
What if you stop making trouble and let people see you

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,600
Unless ah

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,040
Just give me a kiss

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,640
What would you like to eat tonight

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm having dinner with the company tonight

12
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,320
Mr. Xu invited us all to dinner today

13
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,480
Eat and drink well, everyone

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,120
Thank you, boss

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,840
Wish

16
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,400
Our Wonderland culture projects are smooth and profitable

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,240
Smooth and smooth profits

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,800
Cheers, cheers

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Who is Xu Jinfeng

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,720
The brown sugar water you ordered has arrived

21
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,320
Ah

22
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,800
Not bad

23
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,360
Supplementary recording of Yulu's lines: A total of the above nine schemes were shortlisted for our final selection

24
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,680
That's all

25
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
What about the current design scheme

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,560
I don't think it can fully meet the needs of customers

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,200
It is necessary to disassemble the customer's needs in more detail

28
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,320
The re-landing plan needs to be changed again

29
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's meet again next week. Let's break up

30
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,800
What about me? I just spoke as the boss of the company

31
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,520
Now it's speaking as a boyfriend

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,040
Then I want an encouragement of love

33
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,280
Adong's lines are supplemented: Xu Zong

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,520
Someone

35
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,600
Last time, knowing that I was a cleanliness freak, I made such a bad move

36
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
It's a pity. It's a pity

37
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,800
If you can't hurt the enemy, you can't hurt yourself several times

38
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,520
Who knew you had so many stinky problems

39
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that

40
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,520
It's okay. I'm used to it.

41
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
It's all subconscious behavior

42
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,760
After which car accident did your parents

43
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,640
They all went far away

44
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,840
I'm sorry

45
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
I will accompany you in the future

46
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,960
How are you gonna stay with me

47
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
How would you like to be with me

48
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,920
I can accompany you as much as I want

49
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Feed mom

50
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,920
Ball ball

51
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,080
Okay, I know

52
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,400
I thought you said

53
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,440
Yeah

54
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,520
They all moved to America after the car accident

55
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,800
Isn't this far

56
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,520
Okay, my mom just called and said

57
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,080
A friend is going back to China next week

58
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
Let me give you a good treat

59
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
Girls

60
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,560
Clever

61
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
Let me show you the photos

62
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,040
You see

63
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,480
She was a fat boy when she was a child

64
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,760
We all call her Ball Ball

65
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,920
What about next week? Let's have dinner together

66
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,680
Let me introduce you to each other

67
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,520
I don't want it

68
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Ah Feng

69
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,520
It's me, Ball Ball
