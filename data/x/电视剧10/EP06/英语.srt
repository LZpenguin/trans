1
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,640
You eat well and take medicine well

2
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,920
Get well early

3
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,200
You can't delay your own work

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,600
Hello

5
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,720
Jade dew

6
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,920
How are you doing outside all these years

7
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,680
Tell our old classmates what you have

8
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,920
Don't hold on to yourself

9
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,520
It is

10
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,840
I asked my husband to introduce you to someone

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
It's our age, huh

12
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,040
Don't ask for looks and marriage history

13
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,960
You are too demanding since you were a child

14
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,760
How do you do, Miss Lin? You're here

15
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,360
You are a distinguished guest of our boss

16
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,520
He told you to be sure to entertain you

17
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,960
Hey, isn't this BMW our car

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,640
Really

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,600
I told my husband not to pick me up

20
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,520
This is my boss

21
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,200
It's just the boss

22
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,120
That's all

23
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,840
That's not it

24
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,280
A blind date who doesn't belong to our family

25
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
Thank you today

26
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
But I don't think I need money

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,160
Stay up in front of the students

28
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,160
What I am is what I am

29
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm not gonna let their values

30
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,320
And belittle myself

31
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,280
I didn't belittle you

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,880
I'll call you for the meal

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,720
But please don't do this again in the future

34
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,280
And

35
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,200
What I promised you

36
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,000
That's it

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,320
I have my own business to do

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,360
I will go on a blind date with others from tomorrow

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,080
I'll find a way over there

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,440
I disagree

41
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,840
Is my mother's condition getting worse

42
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,960
I'll book a ticket back for tomorrow

43
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,560
Supplementary recording of Yulu aunt's lines: Your mother told me that the most regrettable thing is to bring you up alone

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,600
Yu Lu Yi's lines are supplemented: but I can't see you get happiness

45
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,000
Supplementary recording of Yulu's lines: That's why I spent so much money to find a blind date agency for you

46
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,200
I see

47
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,600
Supplementary Record of Yulu's Lines: Return Your Clothes

48
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,040
This one loves sports

49
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,360
Play volleyball every day

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,480
Visual estimation of height is less than 1.9 meters

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,600
My brother introduces you

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,400
I understand that the height is not written to 1.8 meters

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
It's only 1.6 meters

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,160
I hope to have a child of my own this year

55
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,320
Give my mother an account

56
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,560
Don't worry about watching the children

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,800
Mom living with us will not tire you

58
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,120
You are dressed so exquisitely

59
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
Should be very particular about it

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,080
Girls

61
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,960
Don't pay attention to these unrealistic things

62
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,240
Don't dare to worship money

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
Thank you for coming out with me

64
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
Miss Jiang is polite

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,360
Accompanying clients is what I should do

66
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,440
I just don't know

67
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,520
When we go to the cinema to read the materials,

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,760
You don't really believe what I said, do you

69
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,120
Or are you pretending to understand and pretend to be confused

70
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,080
Or say

71
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,920
You also think reading information is a good excuse

72
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,160
I choose c

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to buy an ice cream

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
I'll buy it

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
Hey

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
You pick up the ticket first

77
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,440
It's too late to wait

78
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
Good

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,080
Nanfeng

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,000
This is the only flavor left

81
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,120
Let's eat together

82
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, I'll go to the bathroom.

83
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,360
Good

84
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,440
Would you like to try some coffee, Miss Lin

85
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,320
What would you like to eat tonight

86
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,680
Jin Feng is next to me, too

87
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,160
Why don't you ask Miss Lin and the four of us to eat together

88
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,320
Ah, Miss Lin went on a blind date

89
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,600
Xu Jinfeng's Supplementary Record: Walking Home

90
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
What I promised you

91
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,760
Let's call it a day

92
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,760
I have my own business to do

93
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,800
I will go on a blind date with others from tomorrow

94
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,480
Let's cancel the contract
