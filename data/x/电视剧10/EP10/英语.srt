1
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,560
Grandma, why are you here

2
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,520
Hey

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,480
Miss Chiang

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,080
Why are you here, too

5
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Come on, everybody raise your glasses

6
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,280
Is that Mr. Tsui Chin-feng

7
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,520
Please come with us

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,880
Grandma, grandma

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,520
Send to hospital

10
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,120
Grandma

11
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,200
I don't want to see her

12
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,320
Grandma

13
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,800
Don't call me Grandma

14
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,640
I brought you up by myself

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,840
You joined a girl film to lie to me

16
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,560
There will be a board meeting soon

17
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,120
How many people are staring at you in the back

18
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
You still have the heart to do that

19
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
As you know, the shareholders' meeting will be held soon

20
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Then you arranged for my blind date to go to England

21
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
That's different

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,280
I will never allow a person who lies to me to enter my house

23
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,240
I already told her at home

24
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,600
I told them to know how they educate their children

25
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,160
Grandma

26
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
Grandma is still angry

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,320
Just wait for her anger to subside

28
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,160
You know

29
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,400
How much does it cost to raise a child

30
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,760
My mother brought me up alone

31
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,840
I can spend all my money on me

32
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,280
But now she's

33
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,080
Because I'm selfish

34
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,240
Touched the world that doesn't belong to me

35
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,280
And blame yourself for not saving some worthy dowry

36
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,640
So that I won't be looked down upon by your family

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,520
How could I feel unworthy

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
We

39
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,920
Split up

40
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm sorry, Yulu

41
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,800
We didn't know you and

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,280
I also told you about him and Director Chen

43
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,920
It's okay. It's all over

44
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,200
Thank you for taking care of me during this time

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,600
We will be competitors in the future

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,960
You have to cheer up

47
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
Ms. Qing Lin Yulu changed jobs with high salary

48
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,520
Grandma's meaning is very firm

49
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,760
Before you and Miss Chen get married

50
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,760
She won't let you out

51
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
How is she

52
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,680
Leave one's job

53
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,240
Her work plan is still in the company's encrypted data

54
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,160
These are all her painstaking efforts

55
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,040
It should belong to her

56
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,120
How about this

57
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,960
You sign this

58
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,320
I'll help you settle all this down

59
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,240
Thank you, brother

60
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Should

61
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
This one has excellent academic performance since childhood

62
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
Master of Tsinghua

63
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,920
Beijing Hukou

64
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,320
COE of Dachang

65
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,760
Have a house and a car

66
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,040
Excuse me, are you Lin

67
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,640
Miss Lin

68
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,160
Excuse me, are you Miss Lin

69
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
The weather is not bad

70
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,800
I didn't expect us to be fellow villagers

71
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm going to buy another house in my hometown in the past two years

72
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,400
If we are destined to be together,

73
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,280
You can also settle your parents together
