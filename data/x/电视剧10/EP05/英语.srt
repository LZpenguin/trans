1
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,440
Xi Zhou

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,240
Xu Jinfeng

3
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,760
Yulu changed his words: Very handsome and sunny

4
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
The kind of boy who will be very popular wherever he puts it

5
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,880
Ah Feng

6
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,640
I bought food and came back

7
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,880
Why did you go to buy it specially

8
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,160
We just got busy, why don't we have a midnight snack together

9
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,440
Auntie, you haven't been to the company since you came so far

10
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,320
Why don't you have dinner together

11
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
Oh, I won't join in the fun when you young people eat

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,880
Quick baby

13
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,640
Don't let someone else treat you

14
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,960
Just treat your mother and eat well

15
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,520
Bye bye

16
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,120
Go away

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,160
Sister, my lifelong happiness

18
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,800
It's up to you

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Am I trying to help you sabotage

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,920
Not Xu Jinfeng

21
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,640
They're not really brothers

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
The handsome boy is nominally Xu Jinfeng's eldest brother

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,880
Actually, it is the adopted son of the Xu family

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,720
That year, Xu Jinfeng's parents had a car accident

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,720
It was a car accident. He was in the car.

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,640
He was in the car, too

27
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,640
No wonder you said you were scared in the elevator just now

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,760
It is estimated that it was the shadow left at that time

29
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,240
Hey

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,360
You said

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,480
Xu Nanfeng, a handsome boy, is the child of their driver

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,120
The driver was adopted by the Xu family after his death

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,120
Xu Jinfeng studied abroad all the year round

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,040
The company is managed by Xu Nanfeng

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,560
Isn't this the script of Ba Zong Nan Er

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,400
But you have the script of the chosen woman

37
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
Are you sure you two are right

38
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,160
How do you know if you don't try

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
Hello, Miss Lin

40
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,920
Boss

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,160
Yulu changed its words: A customer wants to talk to the person in charge of the business. Look

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,000
Yulu changed its words: Is it convenient for you to see it

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
Okay, I see

44
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,520
Done

45
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,120
Is there anything wrong with the company

46
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,160
Xu Nanfeng changed his words; Miss Lin asked me to pick up clients at the company

47
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,080
Then she won't come today, will she

48
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,600
I forgot if you didn't tell me

49
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,360
The company OA has an application for leave

50
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,960
It should be to see that I haven't approved it yet

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
Call specially to rush it

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,040
Leave OA

53
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,000
Miss Chiang

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,680
The customer Miss Lin said is yours

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,080
Mr. Xu, what about the information you want

56
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
It's in my company

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,840
Would you please make a run

58
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,680
No problem

59
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,960
Hey, I reported your car violation

60
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,800
Just now

61
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,280
Take my car

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Row

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,600
What to do

64
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,200
The project exhibition is today

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
I seem to have a fever

66
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
Hello

67
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
I'm afraid I have a fever

68
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,600
Ah, what about that

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
Such an important customer today

70
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,080
Have you prepared all the materials for the project exhibition

71
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,720
You ask the boss for leave first

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,600
I'll find a way to explain the plan here

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,240
Good

74
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,120
All the materials for the afternoon exhibition are here

75
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,480
Do you see anything to add

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,120
This exhibition is very important

77
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,280
Don't make any mistakes

78
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,440
The above is the general situation of this project

79
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,920
What is the original design concept of this project

80
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,960
We use chain design

81
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
This character is called Youni

82
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,000
Because when Qin Shihuang built the Terracotta Warriors and Horses,

83
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,200
Excuse me

84
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
I have something urgent at home

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,200
Next, the vice president will explain to you
