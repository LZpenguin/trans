1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,840
Collected

2
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,080
Come on, come on

3
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,680
How are you?

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,960
Jiang Xizhou

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,640
Hurry up and perform our prepared program to the leader

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,920
No, no, our boss doesn't like this

7
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
Who said that

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,760
I like it

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Jin Feng

10
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,840
Brother

11
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,080
Miss Jiang is so kind to pick me up from work

12
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,880
Mama, I only got seven fans last night

13
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,360
You have to wear sunglasses when you go out tonight

14
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,960
What's the matter? Yeah

15
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,960
Oh, my mother

16
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,960
Let me go on a blind date again

17
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
The old three don't work

18
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,600
No

19
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,400
The main middleman this time is Uncle Liu from Hong Kong

20
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,560
Our family is in urgent need of their support now

21
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,400
Is there no way to refuse

22
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
And the family across the street

23
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,080
We can't be taunted either

24
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,200
Come on, stop acting

25
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,400
What do you need me to do? Say it

26
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,440
Didn't I come to see you here

27
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,760
What about me? I need you to go on a blind date for me

28
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,920
Blind Date Again

29
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,400
You can rest assured that the Xu family has been abroad all the year round

30
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,680
There is no intersection with our family

31
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,880
Absolutely won't wear a gang

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Good

33
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Hello

34
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,040
Well, maybe

35
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
It's a little too bad

36
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,840
Each project team

37
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,320
The team leader is ready to report the project situation to Xu in sequence

38
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,880
There is also Lin Yulu designer of Project b Group

39
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,400
Please come too

40
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,600
According to your orders, the report time has been arranged

41
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Then you told me to buy a summer drink for everyone

42
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,520
I checked the famous fruit and tea shop nearby

43
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,280
Would you mind pineapple tea and peach tea

44
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,360
Wait a minute

45
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,280
Do you order peaches?

46
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
A good boss

47
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,240
Finally, this is for you

48
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,080
It's the old lady who arranged a blind date for you this month

49
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,360
The time has been arranged for you

50
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,880
The nearest one is at 7:00 tomorrow morning

51
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,680
At 7:00 tomorrow morning

52
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Is this big lady going to catch up with the morning shift tomorrow

53
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,840
This lady is in new york

54
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,080
I have booked your flight for tonight

55
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,840
Boss

56
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,520
I'm not saying

57
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,560
That Xu was a misunderstanding yesterday

58
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,840
I'll explain it to Xi Zhou

59
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,280
Then let the Chiang family talk to the middleman

60
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,000
Let the Jiang family tell the middleman that the two sides meet

61
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,000
Everyone thinks it's good

62
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,960
Ah, right, right, right

63
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,320
No, boss. What do you mean

64
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,760
You did a good job

65
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,280
Let's play it for another two months

66
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,800
With what

67
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,080
You can have a look at my weekly newspaper

68
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,560
I work a lot

69
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
There is no time to play house with you

70
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,720
Then I can only tell the middleman

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
Jiang family

72
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,240
I found a little girl to fool me instead of Jiang Xizhou

73
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
The most important thing is

74
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Be sure to let the other party reject the middleman

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,560
Boss, what do I think

76
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,440
My work is not saturated enough

77
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,600
There is still room to work hard

78
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
Go home with me to see grandma that weekend

79
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,320
Do you have an appointment tonight

80
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,720
Overtime

81
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,120
Let's work overtime in a different way

82
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,040
