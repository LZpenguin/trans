1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,840
I heard that the new beauty commercial director

2
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,440
And Xu were always childhood sweethearts

3
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,920
Isn't it a perfect match

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
This is a perfect match

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
The degree of childhood sweetheart

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,200
I dare not even write novels like this

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's a good match, isn't it?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,440
It matches a face too well

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,920
Lulu, have you seen the new beauty

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,040
They match well, they match well

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm getting high. I'm getting high

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,200
Pair-to-pair match-to-match

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,160
What bah bah ah

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,640
Why didn't you go with your childhood sweetheart

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,240
Be jealous

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,360
No

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
I said it was going public

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,440
You have to say this and that yourself

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,000
Then I'll go

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
Hey

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,680
Feng, let's have dinner together tonight

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,120
Good

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Sorry to be late

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,360
Let me introduce Xu Nanfeng, a handsome boy

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,200
This is our birthday girl today, Jia Jia

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
Happy birthday

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,920
Thank you for the cake, handsome boy

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
Now that everyone is here, let's drink one

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,720
Come and wish Jiajia a happy birthday

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,960
Happy birthday

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,760
Thank you

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,240
Sit down. Sit down. Don't be too restrained

33
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Feng, do you remember adults when we were young

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,800
Got us a young marriage

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,360
I was dark and fat at that time

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
You are thin in vain

37
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,800
People thought you were our child bride

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,720
Don't know

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,120
My mother also said that I haven't seen my aunt for a long time

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Visit your aunt at home another day

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
Grandma was very kind to me when I was a child

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,880
I miss Grandma too

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,160
Don't you mind my grandma is good to everyone

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,480
Don't be so polite in private

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Just call me Ball Ball

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,760
My girlfriend will be unhappy

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
I don't want her to be unhappy

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,280
It's impossible for you with your little girlfriend

49
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,440
You don't know your family as well as I do, do you

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,600
Let me ask you, do you dare to take her home

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,920
Don't you know what's going on in your home now

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,600
My family can really help you

53
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,920
Let's play a game

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Old rule, truth or adventure, men first

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
But these

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,400
What does it have to do with yourself

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,000
You have a good brain

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,320
Can stand alone in the company

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,480
People are very kind

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,920
These are the points that have something to do with yourself

61
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,000
It's not me you like either

62
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,680
It's just that your family makes you feel

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
You should like me

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Because I'm the right person

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,840
Childhood sweetheart

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,520
But you don't even know me

67
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,720
Maybe Yulu and I don't have the so-called matching conditions

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
But we love each other and the three views are consistent

69
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
These are in my eyes

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,160
It's far more important than what you said

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,760
The designer of this project is you

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,240
It's me

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,920
This is my first big order in the company

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,520
A list of 2 million

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,520
Don't hold me back

76
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,160
I didn't expect our director Chen to have such a good figure

77
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,960
If I had known, I would have met somewhere else

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,600
Mr. Lu is polite

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
You can come to our restaurant for a drink when you are free

80
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,320
It's covered

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,960
Please apologize to our director

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,920
Apologize for what apology

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh, not really

84
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,600
The offender is not qualified to say so much

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was just kidding

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,440
We can't afford to joke so much, can we

87
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,560
Right, Director Chen

88
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,960
I just happened to see your screensaver

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,680
You have a daughter, too

90
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,480
Do you think this sentence can be said to your daughter

91
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
What you can't say to your daughter

92
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,280
Why would you tell someone else's daughter

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,560
Okay, two million, two million

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,760
If you still want to save a little face,

95
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,120
Then this matter will be settled

96
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,000
Or I'll have to think about it

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
How to communicate with your lover

98
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,040
Why do you want to help me

99
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,520
Shouldn't you bother me

100
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,080
Bother you, but that's between us

101
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
He's right

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,120
You really deserve it

103
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,280
I should say goodbye to my first love

104
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,400
Let's go

105
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,200
Woman

106
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,120
Don't understand

107
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Grandma, why are you here

108
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
Hey

109
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,920
Miss Chiang

110
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Why are you here, too
