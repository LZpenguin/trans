1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,100
I won't work overtime today

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,140
Episode 10

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,300
Mr. Wei

4
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,300
The vice president of our company

5
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,260
Wei Yahan

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,140
She was in charge of

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,220
Internal operations of the company

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,180
She's in charge this year

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,500
Overseas branches managed

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,780
Why did she come back suddenly

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,540
Sister Jiaojiao

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,580
You know her, too

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,900
Sort of knowing each other

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,380
Have I met Concubine Wei

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,340
Quick free gift

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,580
Since the day you became a concubine

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,900
A matter that has been complicated

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,620
Delayed

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,380
I'm only free to be with you today

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,580
Have a good chat

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,700
After that day

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,500
Quiet Concubine

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,660
Zhao Bin and the others didn't

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,660
Let's embarrass you again

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,940
Thanks to Concubine Wei

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,980
No more

27
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,940
There's no need to argue with them

28
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,020
Don't be so shouting

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,980
From now on, we will be called sisters

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,460
Good

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,660
This

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,340
Think of it as a sister celebrating you

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,180
A congratulatory gift from a concubine

34
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,780
Imperial Concubine

35
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,460
This is a reward given to you by the emperor

36
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,180
Your favorite bead hairpin

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,860
Speak out of turn

38
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,340
It's hard for me to hit it off with my sister

39
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,260
Isn't it just a bead hairpin

40
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,540
Thank you, Concubine Wei

41
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,980
What else do you call me

42
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,140
Thank you sister

43
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,220
You see

44
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,420
Mingyue, you say

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,940
If time really could

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,220
Stop at this moment

47
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,500
How nice would that be

48
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,380
When did you come back

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,580
The plane arrived just after it landed this morning

50
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,060
Thanks for hard work

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,460
Our Mr. Li is so indifferent

52
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,660
When I come back, you just say something

53
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,940
Thank you for your hard work. Send me

54
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,780
Without a welcome hug

55
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,780
Your return is equivalent to going home

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,980
Don't need a welcome, right?

57
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,540
Mr. Wei came back so soon

58
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,180
Why is it soon

59
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,460
You don't know

60
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,060
General Wei at the beginning of the year

61
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,780
But for a year

62
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,580
Key Performance Indicators

63
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,180
This is completely

64
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,380
A quarter ahead of schedule

65
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,300
So powerful

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,500
I've heard that

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,580
Mr. Wei is both talented and beautiful

68
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,220
Unexpectedly

69
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,700
It was really like this when I saw it today

70
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,020
I don't know either

71
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,220
Her baby kiss with Mr. Li

72
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,380
Is it true or false

73
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,340
Everyone be quiet

74
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,300
Ready for a meeting

75
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,020
Announce a few things

76
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,940
Recently the company just finished

77
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,100
A big round of hiring

78
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,500
Group III of Personnel Department

79
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,460
In this event

80
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,580
Performed very well

81
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,500
Worthy of recognition

82
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,580
Additionally

83
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,140
Next Personnel Department

84
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,420
The most important job is

85
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,220
Training of new employees

86
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,100
And within the company

87
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,020
Transfer of post

88
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,100
Mr. Wei just came back

89
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,660
In the future, the company's internal operations

90
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,780
Or leave it to her

91
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,460
Mr. Li, can I say a few words

92
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,380
Of course

93
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,300
Everyone here

94
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,740
There are a lot of new faces

95
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:33,980
But everyone should

96
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,020
You know me

97
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,020
Year of the year

98
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,260
Mr. Li put overseas companies

99
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,180
Entrust me

100
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,220
It was originally planned for a year

101
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,580
But I really miss everyone

102
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,740
So the first time

103
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,180
Just rush back to reunite with everyone

104
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,260
Please take care of me in the future

105
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,140
Not bad, still very powerful

106
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,420
Of course

107
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,020
Ordinary people can advance one quarter

108
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,980
Are the key performance indicators completed

109
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,980
I'm talking about her

110
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,260
These words are very powerful

111
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,900
On the one hand

112
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,020
Closer to colleagues

113
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,060
The distance between

114
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,180
On the other hand

115
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,740
Showed again

116
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,060
One's own ability to work

117
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,140
It can be said that it kills multiple birds with one stone

118
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,340
But

119
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,020
The intention of her remarks

120
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,980
What is it

121
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
But

122
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,900
Overseas business is just getting started

123
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,580
I'm not very relieved either

124
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,900
Want to see too

125
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,940
Is there a suitable person

126
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,340
Can take over for me

127
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,340
Now overseas companies

128
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,780
It is the time for rapid development

129
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,500
As long as you go, you will definitely have achievements

130
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,100
This worked overseas for a few years

131
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,300
I will definitely be promoted when I come back

132
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,380
It's a meeting. Don't talk

133
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,380
Sister Jiaojiao

134
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,700
If it were you, would you go

135
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,460
I'd like to go

136
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,020
But with my current

137
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,980
Competence and seniority

138
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,780
It's simply impossible

139
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,980
And I am interested in western countries

140
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,500
Those languages

141
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,180
Not knowing anything

142
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,740
Can't go at all

143
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,460
I just heard Mr. Li praise the third group of personnel

144
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,900
Excellent job performance

145
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,500
I propose

146
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,340
Why don't you let the leaders of the three groups

147
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,940
To take over overseas companies

148
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,820
It's called He Jiaojiao, right

149
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,980
What do you think

150
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,340
She is inexperienced

151
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,220
I'm afraid I'm not

152
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,820
I see

153
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,140
Why don't you let promise go

154
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,740
He's been with me for so many years

155
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,900
It's time to be alone

156
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,620
Not Mr. Li, I

157
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,180
He Jiaojiao, what do you think

158
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,460
Mr. Li

159
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,060
I very much agree with your opinion

160
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,140
But sometimes

161
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,820
Experience and competence

162
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Not necessarily proportional

163
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,220
Sometimes all that's missing is

164
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,020
An opportunity

165
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,900
What do you mean is

166
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,420
I didn't give you a chance

167
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,420
Of course Jiaojiao doesn't mean that

168
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,660
Our company

169
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,420
Will give each

170
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,980
Excellent young opportunities

171
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,660
It's just Mr. Li

172
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,340
Xu Tezhu is gone

173
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,700
What about your assistant

174
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,900
It's Mr. Li

175
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,980
Let He Jiaojiao try it

176
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,020
Didn't she say she didn't give her a chance

177
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,220
Mr. Wei, what do you think

178
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,540
Mr. Li's decision

179
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
Of course I support it with both hands

180
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,740
Is He Jiaojiao competent

181
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,100
Thank you Mr. Wei and Mr. Li for your trust

182
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,020
But my experience is insufficient

183
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,260
As an assistant

184
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,620
Not very good at taking care of people either

185
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,660
And Special Assistant Xu

186
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,500
I've been with you for so many years

187
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,220
That

188
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,060
Do you want to hear my opinion

189
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,540
-Assistant Xu, do you have a problem -Assistant Xu, do you have a problem

190
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,820
No no

191
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,460
Dare not dare not dare not dare

192
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,620
He Jiaojiao

193
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,540
Think clearly and give me the answer

194
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,060
Adjourned the meeting

195
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,780
Jiaojiao

196
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,780
What about this recruitment

197
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,900
I heard Mr. Li say

198
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,060
Well done

199
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,220
Thank you, Mr. Wei

200
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,260
What about the assistant

201
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,540
You don't have to worry too much

202
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,740
Mr. Li looks very serious

203
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,460
But he's actually a

204
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,220
Nice guy

205
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,380
But if you're really worried

206
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,220
You can tell me whenever you want

207
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Don't call me Mr. Wei in the future

208
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,220
Call me Sister Yahan

209
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,740
Thank you, Mr. Wei, for your concern

210
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,460
Okay

211
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,820
If you have something to do there, go and do it first

212
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,220
Good bye Mr. Wei

213
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,580
Mr. Wei is so gentle

214
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,780
Does this look good

215
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,820
Good-looking

216
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,220
Imperial Concubine He

217
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,020
What's wrong

218
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,740
But my sister has something to do with me

219
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,500
Empress

220
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,340
Imperial Concubine

221
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,740
Please go to Asahi Palace

222
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,140
Good

223
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,500
Let's go, little pine nuts

224
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,300
I made it with my own hands

225
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,060
Bring Poria Cake

226
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,340
Good

227
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,860
Give my sister a taste

228
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,220
Empress

229
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,660
Would you like to dress up again

230
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,500
Our mother heard that

231
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,380
How many days have you been

232
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,660
Haven't seen the emperor

233
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,260
She invited the emperor

234
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,580
Go to Asahi Palace together

235
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,860
My sister is so kind to me

236
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,340
You go first

237
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,740
Great, little master

238
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,660
How about it

239
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,460
Your Majesty, the ink is finished

240
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,300
Empress

241
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,500
Pay greetings to the emperor

242
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,620
Pay greetings to the imperial concubine

243
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,940
Sister, come quickly

244
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,140
Unexpectedly

245
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,100
You two have a close relationship

246
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,940
Just in time, let's enjoy the painting together

247
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,060
Appreciate paintings

248
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,020
My sister and I hit it off

249
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,980
The emperor likes his sister

250
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,420
Naturally, I like her, too

251
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,780
Sister Mingyue

252
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,220
Look at this picture

253
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,460
Do you have any ideas

254
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,220
The concubines are poor in talent and poor in learning

255
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,300
Can't understand

256
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,060
Don't be afraid

257
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,660
Say whatever comes to mind

258
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,940
The painting

259
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,220
Pretty beautiful

260
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,420
What else

261
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,900
And

262
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,660
And it draws well

263
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,780
This is the previous dynasty

264
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,100
The most famous painter

265
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,420
Tang Kefan's authentic work

266
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,100
To your mouth

267
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,140
It seems a little tacky

268
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,700
Your Majesty, why should you be angry

269
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,700
Sister Mingyue

270
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,260
I didn't read any books when I was a child

271
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,020
It's normal not to appreciate it

272
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,820
Why should you criticize her

273
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Let me accompany you to enjoy the paintings

274
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,780
This is the authentic work of the Tang family

275
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,180
It's really extraordinary

276
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,260
Look at the distant mountains

277
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,340
Ordinary people draw distant mountains

278
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,380
Often with light ink

279
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,700
And he did the opposite

280
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,900
Put the distant mountains

281
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Expressed with heavy painting and heavy colors

282
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,180
It can be said that viewing heaven and earth with the heart

283
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
And heaven and earth are all in my heart

284
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,260
Good good

285
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,900
As expected of being my beloved concubine

286
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,900
Well said

287
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,900
Okay, you guys go ahead

288
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,460
The emperor drives

289
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,540
Slave retires

290
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,020
Sister I'm sorry

291
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,220
You were kind enough to let me come

292
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,180
And I destroyed

293
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,460
Your pleasure with the emperor

294
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
And you know

295
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,900
I'm really interested in painting

296
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,780
What does that sister think I mean by this move

297
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,820
It won't be

298
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,180
Sister, you can't do this to me

299
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,660
Now that you've guessed

300
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,620
Why should you be so naive

301
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,220
What a good trick

302
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,260
How many times did you save me

303
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,220
Deliberately approaching me

304
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,300
Just for

305
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,780
Understand my weakness, right

306
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,900
You know I'm from an ordinary background

307
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,300
Don't understand painting

308
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,820
Not to mention appreciation

309
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,860
Today you asked me to come over

310
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,460
Just to make the emperor

311
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,740
Loathing at me

312
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,860
My sister really does

313
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,580
An exquisite heart with seven orifices

314
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,500
Why

315
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,820
The world is bustling for profit

316
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,460
You remember

317
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,180
There's everything in this palace

318
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,300
It's just impossible to have

319
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,900
True sisterhood

320
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,580
I will keep in mind

321
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,340
What the imperial concubine said

322
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,980
Let's go back and reflect on it

323
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,900
Mr. Wei

324
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,220
Why do you propose

325
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,580
Let her take over

326
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,540
With her current qualifications

327
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,900
It's simply impossible

328
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,220
Responsible for overseas operations

329
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,420
I started by thinking

330
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,700
Let her be Li Su's assistant

331
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,300
With Li Su's character

332
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,220
He simply couldn't

333
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,980
Like the last one

334
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,020
Someone who is not good enough

335
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,340
And he treats his work

336
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,940
And very harsh

337
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,260
Assistant is not easy to be

338
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,420
He Jiaojiao has no experience

339
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,100
Plus my help

340
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,540
It is inevitable that she will make mistakes

341
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,460
And once she makes a mistake

342
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,860
Li Su will beat it from the bottom of his heart

343
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,060
Really loathe her

344
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,980
This is called killing people and killing their hearts

345
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,340
What if she really refuses

346
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,180
As an assistant

347
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,900
Do you think Li Su

348
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,780
It's possible to like it

349
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,220
A Lian Challenge

350
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,580
A woman who doesn't dare to accept it

351
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,380
Mr. Wei, you are so amazing

352
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,100
Casually

353
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,700
That set her up a dead end

354
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,540
Dasu, you just got off work

355
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,260
Why do you suddenly call me that

356
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,260
When I was a kid

357
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
That's what I call you

358
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,580
Just be casual after get off work

359
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,620
Okay

360
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,100
How about sending me home

361
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,300
Come on, I'm just back home

362
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,020
You wouldn't let myself

363
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,140
Drive back

364
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,220
Okay, I'll send you

365
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,060
-Yeah -Yeah

366
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,460
Go home

367
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,740
Finally know

368
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,660
Why Wei Yahan

369
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,620
You're gonna praise me and kill me

370
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,020
I didn't expect it to be the 21st century

371
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,620
She's still robbing men from me

372
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,220
It's really boring

373
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,580
Good morning, Mr. Li

374
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
Let me press it for you

375
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,260
You don't have to worry about the assistant

376
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,180
If you don't want to, you can

377
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,700
Mr. Li, I'm ready

378
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,260
Today it's me as an assistant

379
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,020
First day in office

380
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,220
Please take care of me

381
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,740
I thought you were scared

382
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,460
What are you afraid of

383
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,060
Can you still eat me

384
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,580
Mr. Li

385
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,660
I didn't mean that

386
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,580
Don't think too much about it

387
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,380
Think more

388
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,660
What do you mean thinking

389
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,100
Mr. Li, the elevator door is closing soon

390
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,900
Please fast forward

391
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,900
Bye

392
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,140
Bye-bye, Mr. Li

393
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:31,740
You

394
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,940
What are you doing

395
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,940
Have you figured it out

396
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,700
Work is not just fun

397
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,460
I've never had

398
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,580
Just thought about having fun

399
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,820
So

400
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,220
That night

401
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,540
Are you serious

402
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,500
I

403
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,100
Go to work first

404
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,580
Come and report for duty in ten minutes

405
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,220
Bye

406
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,860
Today is a good day

407
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,980
Everything can be done tomorrow

408
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,780
Xu Tezhu

409
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,380
Xiao He

410
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,500
Come, come, come, this way, this way

411
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Come on, come on, come on, come on

412
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,980
Then you later

413
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,220
Don't call me Special Assistant Xu anymore

414
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,580
From now on, you will be Special Assistant He

415
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,380
Good

416
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,500
I've packed up all this stuff

417
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,540
And over there

418
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,940
Is an assistant job guide

419
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,900
Anyway, it's very simple

420
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
Just four words

421
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,180
Responsive

422
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,260
Come on, Xiao He

423
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,420
Refuel

424
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,260
Today is a good day

425
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,580
So happy

426
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,420
Give me a cup of coffee

427
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Okay, Mr. Li

428
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,420
Mr. Li, your coffee

429
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,380
Already warm

430
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
You're ready to drink

431
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,860
Why is the coffee a little sweet today

432
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,900
I'm following Special Assistant Xu

433
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,860
The little notebook I gave

434
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,700
It says above

435
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,860
One-third package of sugar

436
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,820
It shouldn't be wrong

437
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,020
Why don't I make another cup

438
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,580
It's okay

439
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,500
You can go back first

440
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,700
OK

441
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,540
Maybe you're sweet

442
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,340
Mr. Li, your snacks

443
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,100
But you're not

444
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,660
Do you always skip snacks in the morning

445
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,900
Forget

446
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,860
OK

447
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,700
If you still need it

448
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,460
Keep calling me

449
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,140
Mr. Li, your newspaper

450
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,300
But now

451
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,940
It's more convenient to watch the news on your mobile phone

452
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,860
I like newspapers

453
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,940
E-newsletters are more environmentally

454
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,700
Mr. Li

455
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,620
The work arrangement has been given to you

456
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,420
It was sent to the mailbox

457
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Do you need anything else

458
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,420
You read it to me again

459
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,900
Mr. Li, I'm an assistant

460
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,180
Not a voice assistant

461
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,860
Hello, Special Assistant Xu

462
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,980
I would like to ask

463
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,220
Mr. Li has been in demand

464
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,620
So many

465
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,420
No.

466
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,380
As long as it's arranged

467
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
Basically nothing happened

468
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,180
Then why did he

469
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,860
Xiao He Ya

470
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,540
If you feel the pressure

471
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,060
You can look at the drawer on the right hand side

472
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,620
I left you a magic weapon

473
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,300
Xiao He

474
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,660
You must stick to it

475
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,540
Don't let Mr. Li again

476
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,860
Calls me back again

477
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,500
OK

478
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,580
Hello

479
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,540
Come to my office

480
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,380
OK

481
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,460
Mr. Li

482
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,740
Is there anything else you can do

483
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,540
Things on my side

484
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,460
There are really a lot

485
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,060
If you don't have

486
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,700
If anything happens

487
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,980
Would you please call me less

488
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,260
Just my first day as my assistant

489
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,140
You can't stand it

490
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,220
That's what you're talking about

491
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,140
Get ready

492
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,180
At your disposal

493
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,580
My tie is messed up

494
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,580
Help me sort it out

495
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:22,660
How

496
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,180
Come on

497
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,060
Mr. Li, I can't wear a tie

498
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
You wouldn't

499
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,260
Still unwilling

500
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,100
Mr. Li

501
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,500
I really can't wear a tie

502
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,940
Try it

503
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,260
Can't let the boss

504
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,100
Do such a small thing

505
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,900
Mr. Li

506
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,900
I'm really not very good at it

507
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,540
It's okay

508
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,980
I can allow you to be stupid once in a while

509
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,340
Mr. Li

510
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,420
Working hours

511
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,980
Can you stop making such jokes

512
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,900
So what do you mean is

513
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,780
Can I talk when I get off work

514
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,020
Will Mr. Li go to the meeting together

515
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,420
Let me do it

516
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,820
It's okay, that's it

517
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,460
Let's go

518
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,220
Mr. Li

519
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,860
Are you satisfied with the new assistant

520
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,780
She really doesn't have much experience

521
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,860
If it doesn't fit

522
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
It's fine. Just her for now

523
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,780
Attach a tie

524
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,340
I don't know anything like this

525
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,500
There will still be a lot of room for development

526
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,620
Now it seems

527
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,140
Some people are full of mistakes and omissions

528
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,540
Why do you suddenly say this

529
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,300
Sometimes

530
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,580
We should probably

531
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
Be more patient

532
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,100
Because some people are worth waiting for

533
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,060
Understand
