1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,060
I won't work overtime today

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,100
Episode 4

3
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,220
Mr. Li, please go back early

4
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,300
Don't disturb my work

5
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,580
Why do you look like a different person again

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,460
I don't forbid them all

7
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,780
Did the regular employee push the job?

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,380
Why are you working overtime so late again

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,780
I didn't finish it myself

10
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,180
It's quite honest

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,060
Show me, I'll show it for you

12
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,540
Can you finish it quickly

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,940
No thanks

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,380
That's your tea

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,060
Can I have a taste

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,940
Pour yourself

17
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,700
Can I have a cup of tea

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,580
West Lake Longjing

19
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,380
Whether you like to drink or not

20
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,780
How do you know I like it

21
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,900
You went out of your way to investigate my preferences

22
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,860
If you put your heart on me

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,420
Half of it is spent on work

24
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,500
You don't have to work overtime

25
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,100
Mr. Li, your time is very precious

26
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,260
So I ask you not to

27
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060
Waste time on mine

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,340
What are you doing

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,540
Eviction order

30
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,100
Ai Fei is sleepy

31
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,420
Let's go back to the bedroom and rest

32
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,220
Has been processed

33
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,820
He Mingyue

34
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,260
You must not

35
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,660
Be fooled by this trick again

36
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
Trying to touch me secretly

37
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,860
I'm off work

38
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,100
Let's go back

39
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,660
Hello, second sister

40
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,980
What's wrong

41
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,660
You're too old.

42
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,020
But it still looks appropriate

43
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,700
I think Yahan is good

44
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,140
If you don't like it

45
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,540
Let me introduce you to a few more

46
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,980
Done

47
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
Don't rush

48
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,540
I'm interested in girls now

49
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,020
I'm busy first. I'm hanging up

50
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,300
This thing called instant noodles

51
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,500
It smells quite fragrant

52
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,380
Don't rush

53
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,820
I'll send you in five minutes, five minutes

54
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,940
What are you sending?

55
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Sister Jiaojiao, you are still working on weekends

56
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,740
Zhao Ting hasn't stopped since eight o'clock in the morning

57
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,980
Been asking me for information

58
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980
Sister Zhao Ting

59
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,740
I saw her shopping just now

60
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,660
I didn't expect that

61
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,380
It seems that we can't spare her

62
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,060
Sister Jiaojiao, what are you thinking?

63
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,940
Nothing

64
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,220
Just wanted to have a friendly exchange with her

65
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,140
Come on, I'll cut you another steak

66
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,820
Thank you dear

67
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,180
I've eaten enough

68
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,820
Thank you

69
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,780
Today's food is delicious

70
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,100
I especially like it

71
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,620
But my side

72
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,780
There is still some work unfinished

73
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,020
So I might have to leave early

74
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,220
Then be careful

75
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,100
Then we'll get in touch

76
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,420
Remember to call me later

77
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,620
I'm leaving first

78
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,940
Bye

79
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,580
Honey, you've been waiting for a long time

80
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,340
Thank you

81
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,820
My dear

82
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,100
Because I just had something

83
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,500
So I'm late

84
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,220
You don't blame people, do you

85
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,140
You're so kind

86
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,740
That

87
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,940
There is a place I really want to go to

88
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,220
Why don't you go with someone else

89
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,700
Then let's go

90
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,700
It's okay

91
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,300
Honey, your hair is so handsome today

92
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,340
Baby, you still

93
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,540
Please answer the phone

94
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,300
Hello, Sister Ting

95
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,860
Hello

96
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,860
I have sent you the information

97
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,540
You can just send me an email address

98
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,380
I'll read it when I get back then

99
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,060
Like this

100
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,700
But you still

101
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,500
Hurry up and take a look

102
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,100
Is it okay

103
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,140
Hang up

104
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,020
Honey, then let's go

105
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,900
Why don't you finish it first

106
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,700
Hello

107
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,180
Hello Sister Ting

108
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,740
My information

109
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
I've been sending it to you for so long

110
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,380
Why don't you watch it

111
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,940
Jiaojiao

112
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
It's the weekend and you don't

113
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,580
Settle the bill

114
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,780
What happened to the baby

115
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,220
I

116
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,500
Tingting, who is this

117
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,260
Baby, who is this boy

118
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,660
I have work to do

119
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,220
Give me your phone

120
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,100
Sister Ting, I'm here

121
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
I really can't afford to delay

122
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,420
Really

123
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,700
He Jiaojiao, you're enough

124
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,460
Sister Ting

125
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,300
Why don't you reply to my message

126
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,060
Go to bed early. Good night

127
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,420
Momma da

128
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,020
Sister Jiaojiao, why did you come so early

129
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,580
Come to work

130
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,220
Don't you have a lot of rest

131
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Anyway, every day we

132
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,660
It's all sent by express delivery

133
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,700
Organize and organize documents

134
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,780
Screen resumes or something

135
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,940
And there's no other chance

136
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,940
Why are you so energetic

137
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,860
If there is no chance

138
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,620
So the best way to get the opportunity

139
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,220
Is doing everything well

140
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,060
Little Master

141
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,940
Our location is so remote

142
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,700
The emperor won't come at all

143
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,420
He doesn't even see us

144
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,460
You spend every day

145
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,900
So much thought about makeup

146
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,100
What the hell is it doing

147
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,100
Why is our Komatsu wronged

148
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,100
I just can't figure it out

149
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,900
Why waste your mind

150
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,020
This is not a waste of effort

151
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,060
Opportunities are always left

152
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,300
Of a prepared person

153
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,100
Things we can do

154
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,660
Is to do the best that you can do

155
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,340
Dear little masters

156
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,020
Today, the emperor has a sudden elegance

157
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Call all concubines to visit the garden together

158
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,260
Enjoy the spring scenery together

159
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,180
Little masters, please leave now

160
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,820
Thank you father-in-law

161
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,460
The emperor arrives

162
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,340
Emperor

163
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,980
You are the concubine He of the Dawn Moon Palace

164
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,500
Return to the emperor's words, yes

165
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,340
Ai Fei, do you think the flowers are beautiful

166
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,380
This flower blooms so beautifully

167
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,380
The emperor's vision

168
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,060
It's really unbeatable

169
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,260
The emperor's concubines are conscious

170
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,900
All right

171
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,460
I look at the concubines

172
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,260
Poor complexion

173
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,860
Thin clothes

174
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,060
Let's go back and rest

175
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,420
Yes

176
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,300
He Bin

177
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,180
You stay

178
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,300
Love Concubine

179
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,900
I think

180
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,180
Only you are more beautiful than this flower

181
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,220
Everyone, in five minutes, the big conference room

182
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,460
Mr. Li wants to hold a meeting for everyone

183
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,220
By the way, interns also have to attend

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,020
Don't be late, everyone

185
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,620
Mr. Li, what's going on recently

186
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,780
Call meetings so frequently

187
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,580
Are you interested in it

188
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,620
Who's in our center

189
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,660
You little brain

190
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,700
Still worrying about the boss

191
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,900
I think he must have a crush on you

192
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,100
The company will expand further in the future

193
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,180
So today's meeting

194
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,180

200
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,300
Jiaojiao, don't get me wrong

201
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,460
I didn't mean to rush you

202
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,300
I just wanted to say

203
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,420
What if you can't do it yourself

204
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,820
You can tell me

205
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
I can help you

206
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,780
No thank you Sister Ting

207
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
That

208
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,060
Come on

209
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,380
We make progress together

210
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,420
In the past year

211
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,180
The resumes that passed the preliminary screening are

212
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,260
Three thousand four hundred and two copies

213
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,980
The pass rate is 2.7 percent

214
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,100
Final admission and passing the probation period

215
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,780
2.729 percent

216
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,580
Received in total

217
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,820
One hundred and twenty-four thousand seven hundred

218
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,140
Sixty-two resumes

219
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,220
Those who passed the primary were

220
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,460
Three thousand four hundred and two copies

221
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,140
Accurate to three decimal places

222
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,620
So the data should be

223
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,900
2.729 percent

224
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,380
If behind

225
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,740
The data is still inaccurate

226
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,340
Then there is no need to report

227
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,380
I'm sorry, Mr. Li

228
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,580
It's because we don't work properly

229
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,100
How was the hiring situation last month

230
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,740
Mr. Li, this

231
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,460
This data hasn't been counted yet

232
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,500
Today is only the third

233
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,700
So

234
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,780
Your entire center

235
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,100
No one knows

236
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,100
Li Jiakai, you come and report

237
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,740
Aren't you responsible for Zhao Ting

238
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,620
You report

239
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,540
He Jiaojiao

240
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,660
I left her in charge

241
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,580
Refuel

242
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,420
Who doesn't know

243
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,980
He Jiaojiao is an intern

244
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,820
It's this evasion layer by layer

245
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,260
If you don't, you will hit it

246
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,620
Is it on the intern's head

247
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,500
Co-author someone else came for an internship

248
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,420
Just to learn

249
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,580
How did you take the blame
