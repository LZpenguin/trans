1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,060
I won't work overtime today

2
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,100
Episode 7

3
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,180
Bright moon

4
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,740
Are you willing to stay with me for the rest of my life

5
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,380
If you live up to it

6
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,260
I will never give up

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,220
Bright moon

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,140
Didn't you always want to

9
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,420
Do you want me to accompany you to enjoy the moon

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,260
This evening

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,220
I'll accompany you, okay?

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,220
Really

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,380
Your Majesty, Your Majesty

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,300
Something went wrong

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,540
My concubine Zhao

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,740
Be uncomfortable

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,140
You are noisy and refusing to eat

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,900
Your Majesty

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,020
Stop making a fuss

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:01,940
I

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,380
I'm going to have a look

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,540
Emperor

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,180
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, please take a look

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,500
They exactly

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,140
Is it the same person

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,260
Empress

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,220
I didn't expect

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,620
You are a self-serving person

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,220
How can you be like this? How can you be so impressed with the world

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,180
I'm so disappointed by this

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,900
I've never felt

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,980
You are a self-serving person

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,260
People who like to bully others

34
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,380
Men or something

35
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,460
Everyone step aside

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,420
Getting into a career is the right way

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,780
Sister Jiao, you're here

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,980
I heard that Sister Zhao Ting resigned

39
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,540
It's okay to resign

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,860
Is it you

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,900
I don't bother to do this to her

42
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,060
I should be embarrassed

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,140
Have you stayed

44
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,620
Come on, everyone, please stop for a moment

45
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,540
Where's Director Wu

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,820
There is a very important thing

47
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,660
To announce

48
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,180
Team battle recruitment plan

49
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,260
Is it from your group

50
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,300
Which one of you brought it up

51
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,980
Director Wu, what do you mean

52
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,900
Mr. Li felt

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,180
This scheme is very creative

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,340
Very cost-effective and feasible

55
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,060
Sister Jiaojiao

56
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,300
Is it your plan

57
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,860
Sure enough

58
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,500
Li Su or

59
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,140
More inclined to go on dangerous roads

60
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,180
Director Wu actually

61
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,820
Director Wu

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,620
What about this idea

63
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,740
It was originally put forward by me

64
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,540
Then I'll write it for everyone

65
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,780
What about this project

66
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,540
Can it be approved by Mr. Li

67
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,140
It's really a great honor

68
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,660
Everyone's recent efforts

69
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
It's not in vain

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,500
Is it right

71
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,820
OK

72
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,020
Then you continue to lead them

73
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,060
Refine this scheme

74
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,100
Do a good job

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,660
You obviously wrote it

76
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,500
Why in his mouth

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,220
Become what he put forward

78
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,220
I asked you to write it

79
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,660
That scheme

80
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,900
Has nothing to do with him

81
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,060
Isn't this grabbing credit

82
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,220
It's too bullying

83
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,100
No way

84
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,620
I'm gonna fight for you

85
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,020
Go ahead

86
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,980
What do you do

87
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,820
Say it well if you have something to say

88
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,740
You shameless thing

89
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,780
Take the credit of my boss

90
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,500
If you don't talk nicely

91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,100
What are you doing

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,300
-You piece of trash -You piece of trash

93
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,220
You piece of trash, I'll beat you to death

94
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,220
Beat you to death Beat you to death

95
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,860
All right, all right

96
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,700
What are you giggling at

97
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,860
What are you giggling at

98
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,340
Aren't you going to fight your life

99
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,700
A gentleman talks but doesn't do anything

100
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
Let me change the way

101
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm going to find Director Wu

102
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,620
Don't worry about it. It's useless

103
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,940
In the workplace

104
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,100
The boss bullying the subordinate

105
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,980
There are plenty of them

106
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,940
That

107
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,460
Then let him

108
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,460
Steal the fruits of other people's labor

109
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,500
Keep squeezing you

110
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,260
Pattern determines the upper limit

111
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,020
The more short-sighted he is

112
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,500
The more you will suffer the consequences

113
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,540
My company

114
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,740
There's no room for such a person

115
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,620
YOUR COMPANY

116
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,740
How did this become

117
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,420
Your company

118
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,940
Sooner or later it will be mine

119
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,140
Not to mention

120
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,500
Who says I'm gonna put up with him

121
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,940
Last time you dared to do this

122
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,100
Someone who bullies me

123
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,860
Still kneeling in the cold palace

124
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,420
Sister, I found out

125
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,380
Every time you do this

126
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,500
When talking nonsense

127
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,020
That's when you're ready to make an enlarged move

128
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,180
Okay, Komatsu

129
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,340
Getting smarter

130
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,500
Fuck him

131
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,180
Let's go, Brother Kai

132
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,780
What time will I get off work

133
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,980
Let's go first

134
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,500
Chief inspector

135
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,820
Don't worry

136
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,980
I will definitely tomorrow

137
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,140
Send you the plan

138
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,900
No, isn't this working overtime

139
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,780
You can rest assured that I will do things

140
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,180
Okay, please go to bed early

141
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,500
Jiaojiao is still busy

142
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,100
Get things done tonight

143
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,260
Send it to me

144
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,580
Come on

145
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,220
I have something to do now. I'll leave first

146
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,940
That brother Kai

147
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,700
I keep having a problem that I don't quite understand

148
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,860
Can you

149
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,260
You have to learn if you have a problem

150
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,740
Solve it yourself first

151
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,660
If it doesn't work, Baidu first

152
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,380
Right

153
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,060
OK

154
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,300
You see how much I trust you

155
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,180
Such an important job

156
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,380
I'll leave it to you

157
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,100
You have to seize the opportunity

158
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,060
You get down a little bit

159
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,220
Go down

160
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,180
Shh

161
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,940
Such a huge office

162
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm the only one working overtime

163
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,340
Come on, Brother Kai, work hard

164
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,460
That tonight

165
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,940
Be sure to get things done

166
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,980
Then send it to me first

167
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,980
No problem

168
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,300
Refuel

169
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:10,860
Refuel

170
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,220
Bye

171
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,100
Bye bye bye bye

172
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Walk slowly without sending off

173
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,100
Refuel

174
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,660
Finally finished writing

175
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,140
Just print it out

176
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,960
Come on, Brother Kai, work hard

177
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,180
Hello

178
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,380
Mr. Li

179
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
I don't drink porridge

180
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,780
Must drink

181
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,100
I know you don't like it

182
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,420
Something bland and tasteless

183
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,940
And always eat spicy and exciting food

184
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,220
Sometimes busy with work

185
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,940
Don't even eat a meal

186
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,460
This is too bad for your stomach

187
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,700
Must drink porridge

188
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,260
If you don't like it, you have to drink it quickly

189
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,060
Are you concerned about me

190
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,780
There is still time for stomach pain

191
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,540
Say so much

192
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,500
Drink quickly, I'm leaving

193
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,380
Get up quickly

194
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,660
Get up

195
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,660
Open your mouth

196
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,140
Hot

197
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,380
Are you feeling better

198
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,020
Does your stomach still hurt

199
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,220
You rub it yourself

200
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,220
No, I'm in too much pain

201
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,140
I can't rub it myself

202
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,420
It's all in the play

203
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,380
It looks good

204
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,540
Drink it yourself and drink two more sips

205
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,300
I'm leaving

206
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,060
Can

207
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,380
Will you stay with me a little longer

208
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,860
Forget it, it's getting late

209
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,140
You can go back first

210
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,260
Okay, I'll go back to the office and get my stuff

211
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,220
Can I work overtime in your office

212
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,300
Can

213
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,580
What are you busy with again

214
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,820
Work overtime so late

215
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,340
Make a plan How about you

216
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,940
The company is not now

217
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,820
Is it expanding

218
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,780
A lot of things

219
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,820
I need to handle it myself

220
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,020
Some are very urgent

221
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,660
Then remember to eat well

222
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,340
Listen to you

223
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,460
What's wrong

224
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,180
It's okay. Work hard

225
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,940
Yao shang me Yao shang me

226
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,740
Fuck me fuck me

227
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,780
Come

228
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,020
Fuck me

229
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,340
Come on, come on

230
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,700
What are you doing? Run away

231
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:00,860
Brother Kai

232
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,780
Brother Kai, please also have a look

233
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Give me some guidance

234
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:08,900
Good

235
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,580
Wait till I'm done

236
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Not finished

237
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,820
I'll watch it when I'm done

238
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:13,780
Go ahead

239
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,420
Thank you, Brother Kai

240
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,580
Does it look good

241
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,740
I think you could change the color

242
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,220
Change the color

243
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,980
Little plum to Concubine He

244
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,820
Please say hello

245
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,780
Xiao Li's father-in-law came this time

246
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,740
Is there anything to do

247
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,860
Return to the Empress's words

248
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,340
My lady heard that you

249
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,500
Written a good handwriting

250
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,540
So I'd like to ask you to help her

251
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,820
Copy a Buddhist scripture

252
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,500
Why didn't Concubine Zhao copy it herself?

253
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,100
Bold

254
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,220
Where did the dog minion come from

255
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,820
How dare you call out

256
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,100
My Empress's name is taboo

257
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,740
After all, he is from the inferior class

258
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,900
Just don't understand the rules

259
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,300
Father-in-law Xiao Li, please calm down

260
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,220
It's Little Songzi who's ignorant

261
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,100
Remove small pine nuts

262
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,340
Take over the Buddhist scriptures

263
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:24,900
You

264
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,100
Mother, please copy it quickly

265
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,140
My mother

266
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,500
But I want it tomorrow

267
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,740
Tomorrow

268
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,820
If you don't get it tomorrow

269
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,780
My empress may be angry

270
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,380
Then while waiting on the emperor

271
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,020
What did you say to the emperor

272
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,460
It's you who suffer

273
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,140
Thank you, Father-in-law Xiao Li

274
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,180
Walk slowly and don't send it off

275
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,780
Brother Kai, you have to report the plan

276
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,860
Use me to come with you

277
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,460
Your plan

278
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,660
There are still many problems

279
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,100
I'll have to help you later

280
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,140
Do it all over again

281
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,580
Where's the director's side

282
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,900
If there's anything I can do for you

283
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,940
Thank you, Brother Kai

284
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,460
Go ahead

285
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,220
I'm leaving first

286
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,140
The little girl is still too young

287
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,100
Li Jiakai

288
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,900
You really did this

289
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,500
Yes

290
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Director Wu

291
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,700
Do you see what's wrong

292
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm gonna take it right away and modify it

293
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,220
Well done, very thoughtful

294
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,740
I underestimated you before

295
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,660
No No No

296
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
Or thanks to

297
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,380
Director Wu's care and cultivation

298
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,340
I'll make you

299
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,140
Tell Mr. Li everything

300
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,940
This project

301
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,420
If it is officially implemented

302
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,540
Nine times out of ten

303
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,820
Will leave it to you

304
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,460
Seize the opportunity

305
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,100
Director Wu, don't worry

306
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,860
This time I

307
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,460
I promise to complete the task successfully

308
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,260
Don't worry

309
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,940
Director that

310
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,100
My relatives gave me

311
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,460
Two cans of tea were mailed

312
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,660
It tastes particularly good

313
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,380
I'll send it to you later

314
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,260
Don't do this

315
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,140
As long as you have the strength

316
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,740
The opportunity is yours

317
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,180
Okay, Director Wu

318
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,580
Then I will withdraw the director first

319
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,060
Go back and get busy

320
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,780
Good

321
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,420
Zhao Bin, did you copy all this

322
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,580
Return to the Queen Mother's words

323
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,860
These are all concubines

324
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,220
Personally copied

325
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,500
It's a good handwriting

326
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,380
Thank you Queen Mother for your praise

327
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,740
Why is the last sentence missing

328
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,340
Return to the Queen Mother's words

329
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,300
I think this should

330
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,780
It was when my sister was copying the scriptures

331
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,420
I think this last sentence

332
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,420
Is that the finishing touch of the whole story?

333
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,220
I want to paint this dragon with a bright stroke

334
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,340
I'll leave it to you to make up for it

335
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,940
Is Zhao Bin like this

336
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's how it works

337
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,060
Good

338
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,780
When I read Buddhist scriptures

339
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,820
I love this sentence best

340
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,740
Zhao Bin

341
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,540
You have a bit of wisdom

342
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,020
Inappropriate inappropriate

343
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,660
Queen Mother

344
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,620
Excuse me, what do you think

345
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,380
What's wrong with it

346
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,180
Your handwriting is beautiful

347
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,420
In one go

348
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,780
If I am rash

349
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,100
Plus the last stroke

350
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,260
That's not beautiful

351
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,060
Concubine Zhao, it's better for you to do it

352
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,460
Why haven't you started writing yet

353
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,540
I

354
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,220
Queen Mother

355
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,340
Queen Mother

356
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,180
You must decide for me

357
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,980
What else do you have to say

358
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,740
Empress, it's her

359
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,900
She set me up on purpose

360
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,220
The Buddhist scripture is covered in her handwriting

361
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,980
She must have dropped the bag on purpose

362
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,060
Empress

363
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,100
Empress

364
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,460
You must decide for me

365
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,260
Concubine He has this matter

366
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,580
Please learn from the Queen Mother

367
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,500
The lettering on this Buddhist scripture

368
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,780
Not a concubine's font

369
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,780
I don't know why

370
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,860
My sister wants to say that about me

371
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,740
He Mingyue, you

372
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,580
This is clearly

373
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,660
Font for two people

374
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,780
You messed up the Ai family's birthday party

375
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,260
There is no sincerity in copying the scriptures

376
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,020
And slandered others and fooled the mourning family

377
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,580
Who gave you the courage

378
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,460
Someone drag her out

379
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,500
In limbo

380
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,820
Kaige Kaige

381
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,540
How about it? What did Director Wu say

382
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,940
Jiaojiao

383
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,700
You're still inexperienced

384
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,900
After Director Wu read it

385
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,980
Not quite satisfied

386
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,700
But it's okay

387
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:34,860
I turned back

388
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,460
Help you make another one

389
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,780
Let Director Wu again

390
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,540
Take another look

391
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,900
Thank you, Brother Kai

392
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,180
But

393
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,700
I'm pretty optimistic about you

394
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,260
Wait until I get promoted and raise

395
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,020
My position

396
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,260
Maybe it's you

397
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,460
Thank you, Brother Kai, come on

398
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,500
Refuel

399
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,780
Go ahead

400
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,860
Bye

401
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,140
After receiving credit, you still want to pretend to be a good person

402
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,940
That's all you want to get promoted

403
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,340
I hope Li Su won't disappoint me
