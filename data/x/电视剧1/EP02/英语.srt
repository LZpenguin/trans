1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,060
I won't work overtime today

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Episode 2

3
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,500
Mr. Li

4
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,540
Do you drink water

5
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,940
I'm sorry, Mr. Li

6
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,940
Let me wipe it for you

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,580
What's going on

8
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,740
Why are you stumbling me

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,780
I'm sorry

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,660
Don't move

11
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,060
Thank you

12
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,140
Emperor

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,260
Emperor

14
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,500
I handle it myself

15
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,740
You guys work

16
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,260
Mr. Li, I'll see you off

17
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,060
I hired you to come

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,420
Is it specifically for me

19
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,180
My hands are slender and long

20
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,460
And a faint fragrance

21
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,620
What is she doing

22
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,940
Want to use this method

23
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,220
Caught my attention

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,180
Scattered, scattered, scattered

25
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,900
He Jiaojiao

26
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,380
Just wait for me

27
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,820
After all, living under the eaves

28
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,420
Still have to control your emotions

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,380
But it's so cool

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,740
So my name is He Jiaojiao

31
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,580
Dwelling in

32
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,820
Room 301, 18 Orange Tseng Road

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,620
Mobile Number

34
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,860
Photocopied papers are laid on the table

35
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,900
I don't know to send it to everyone

36
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,340
You changed your abacus

37
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,220
Dial it and move it

38
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,700
What do you do

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,860
Give me another stare and try

40
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,220
Sister Jing

41
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,380
I'm going right now

42
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,620
The last document

43
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,220
It's actually for him

44
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,860
In ancient times, there was a king of Yue who slept down and tried his courage

45
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,980
The existing bright moon contains dirt and endurance

46
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,420
Not yet

47
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,500
When dealing with him

48
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,340
Enter

49
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,740
Put your stuff there

50
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,940
Give me the clothes

51
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,460
How can it be you

52
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,180
It's not Special Assistant Xu

53
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,100
Can you send me clothes

54
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,260
I'm sorry, Mr. Li

55
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,580
I'm here to deliver documents

56
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,060
Then why didn't you tell me earlier

57
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,260
I want to say

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,380
But you take it off more urgently

59
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,220
I think you did it on purpose

60
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
Deliberately wanted to see me

61
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,780
Can you not

62
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,220
I feel so good about myself

63
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,140
You, you, you still dare to get started

64
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,340
That's it

65
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,500
Practice again

66
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,300
And I'm not interested in you

67
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,860
Mr. Li, your

68
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,380
You

69
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,020
Clothes

70
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,140
Get closer

71
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,860
Feed me

72
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,700
I actually

73
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,220
I was really fascinated by him

74
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,700
It's really unbearable to look back

75
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,660
It takes so long to send a file

76
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,900
Take this file and print it

77
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,740
Three minutes later I'm going to

78
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,060
He Jiaojiao adds watermark

79
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,180
He Jiaojiao

80
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,460
What are you still doing

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Why don't you go and collect the express delivery

82
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,660
He Jiaojiao

83
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,020
He Jiaojiao

84
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,780
Go turn off the air conditioner

85
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,220
Thanks for hard work

86
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,980
What the hell is this

87
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,740
Dark

88
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,580
Is this drinkable

89
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,580
Coffee

90
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,100
Don't give it to me again

91
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,420
What kind of coffee are you drinking

92
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,820
Drinking the West Lake Longjing used to paying tribute

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,060
I really can't get used to this

94
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,380
Gong Gong Tea

95
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,340
Where can I get it for you

96
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,060
Then make do

97
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,260
Find me some white water

98
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,940
It's really not as good as before

99
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,940
Sister Jiaojiao

100
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,140
You're talking nonsense again

101
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,820
Sister Jing, she is very narrow-minded

102
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,180
She's targeting you like this today

103
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,380
You don't worry about the future

104
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,980
Just her

105
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Casually

106
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,700
I have a hundred ways to get her

107
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,740
Off work

108
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,300
Off work

109
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,660
Well, can we go now

110
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,940
We can't go

111
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,140
We have to work overtime

112
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,460
Why

113
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,540
Because

114
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,380
Because there is a kind of overtime

115
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,740
It's called the leader hasn't got off work yet

116
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,060
And some kind of overtime

117
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,020
It's called a leader looking for trouble temporarily

118
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,860
Survival in the workplace food chain

119
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,900
We at the bottom

120
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,260
There is no right to choose

121
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,140
We

122
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,420
Here it is

123
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,700
They all feel very leisure, don't they

124
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,140
I'm done with ours

125
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,340
That's just right

126
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,420
I'll give you some information later

127
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,660
You guys sort it out

128
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,780
And then what

129
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,180
Scan another electronic file

130
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,820
Re-use table statistical summary

131
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,660
Send me email

132
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,820
I want to review tomorrow

133
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,380
Let me tell you

134
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,500
It must be done within today

135
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,100
I want to see tomorrow

136
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,420
What if I can't finish it

137
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,180
Then you can resign yourself on your own initiative

138
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,140
Our company doesn't need waste

139
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,300
Just a quiet concubine

140
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,100
You dare to shout and drink at me

141
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
Put her on hold for a few days

142
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,940
Empress Zhao Concubine

143
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,980
To spare you the death penalty

144
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,540
But you bumped into her

145
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,300
Tonight you guys

146
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,260
We need to put this warehouse

147
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,180
It's all sorted out

148
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,100
Mammy

149
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,340
How can I finish this night

150
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
That's your business

151
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,060
Let you have a long memory

152
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,540
Sister Mingmingyue, don't be afraid

153
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,860
I, I protect you

154
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,780
Good

155
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,940
Then what are you shaking

156
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,340
Let's get started

157
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,620
Start sorting out the big items first

158
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,580
It's faster this way

159
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,100
Sister Mingyue

160
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
I'm sorry

161
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,140
I'm the one who got you into trouble

162
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,820
It's okay

163
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,900
We can do it

164
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,180
Refuel

165
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,020
Come on

166
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,020
It seems that no matter where

167
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,100
If you are weak, you will be bullied

168
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,900
Sister Jiaojiao

169
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,260
Do you like watching the sunrise

170
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,140
Why do you ask

171
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,540
According to this posture

172
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,060
We can't finish it tomorrow morning

173
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,500
It's okay

174
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,100
The less likely it seems

175
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,140
Things accomplished

176
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,620
The more you complete it, the more meaningful it is

177
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,220
We can do it

178
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,060
And

179
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,020
Watch the sunrise with you

180
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,460
Very happy too

181
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,820
Finally done

182
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,340
Sister Mingyue, look

183
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,900
Sunrise

184
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,900
Komatsu, do you believe it

185
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,420
One day

186
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,500
I'll take you there

187
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,580
The highest place in the city

188
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,540
Watch the sunrise

189
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,300
Finally finished

190
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,580
Sister Jiaojiao

191
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,340
Why are you so fast

192
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,500
This is compared to

193
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,940
Compared with organizing the palace warehouse

194
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
It's too simple

195
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,100
I'll do it

196
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,140
Just in time for you to teach me

197
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,580
How to build an electronic file

198
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,180
Good

199
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,340
Watch this

200
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,100
Sent out

201
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,020
But email and wechat

202
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,380
Sister Jing didn't even reply to me

203
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,060
I think she should be asleep

204
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,060
Both now

205
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,820
It's eleven o'clock

206
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,780
We often

207
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,940
Do you work overtime so late

208
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
We interns

209
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,020
This is the company

210
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,180
The lowest level of workers

211
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,940
Any regular employee

212
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,820
Can be exploited

213
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,580
Especially those like Sister Jing

214
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,620
Relying on my years of qualifications

215
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,420
All her work

216
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,540
It's all done by interns

217
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,860
Looks like we can't keep her

218
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,460
Pick me up downstairs in five minutes

219
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,780
We're supposed to be this company

220
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,300
Is it the latest person to get off work?

221
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,580
That's not necessarily true

222
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,020
Maybe Mr. Li is still here

223
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,780
He works overtime until late every time

224
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,940
Is it

225
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,780
Sister Jiaojiao

226
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,820
It's so late

227
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,820
Or else

228
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,660
Come on, I'll take you back

229
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,580
Let me take you back

230
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,820
You take me back

231
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,020
You forgot everything

232
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,780
Do you remember

233
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,860
Where is Orange Well Road

234
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,860
I'm just not familiar with

235
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,780
It's not like you're stupid

236
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,580
All right, let's go

237
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,300
Then I'm leaving

238
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,140
Don't worry

239
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,860
Honk the horn

240
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,020
No matter how powerful

241
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,660
She's just a little girl

242
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,140
How can there be such a good-looking person

243
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,580
Why hasn't Sister Jiaojiao come yet

244
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,580
Everyone saw it

245
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,180
Dare to be late during the internship period

246
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,060
Good morning, Sister Jing

247
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,100
Are you doing anything

248
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,420
Why are you only coming to work now

249
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,780
It's eight fifty-nine

250
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,620
Working time is nine o'clock in the morning

251
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,860
I'm just in time

252
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,220
Is there a problem

253
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,980
What about yesterday's work? Give me

254
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,100
Sister Jing

255
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,140
I advise you to return your

256
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,340
Take a look at the work station

257
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,340
If you open the mailbox

258
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,540
There should be an answer

259
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,940
Yeah, yeah

260
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,260
I sent your email yesterday

261
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,180
But you didn't reply

262
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,700
The information is on your desk, too

263
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,020
Sister Jing

264
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,860
Very good

265
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,980
You two better not

266
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,860
What's wrong with me

267
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,580
Go make me a cup of coffee

268
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,180
Are you sure

269
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,820
Go ahead

270
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,860
What are you talking about?

271
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,660
It really is

272
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,460
We're not servants

273
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,060
Make coffee and call us

274
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,860
It will be very bitter if you soak so much

275
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,780
Is it

276
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,660
I'd better make a new cup

277
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,820
No need

278
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,220
I'll do it

279
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,340
Sister Jiaojiao

280
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,220
Sister Jing, she really goes too far

281
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,060
But you early in the morning

282
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,940
Talk to her like that

283
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,020
She's already very unhappy

284
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,500
She'll definitely be picky about coffee

285
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,940
You pissed her off like this

286
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,020
So what

287
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,420
As if she couldn't do anything

288
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,500
Let's walk straight and sit straight

289
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,740
There's nothing to be afraid of

290
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,380
Besides, if you get angry, just get angry

291
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,860
Wait for her to bite the hook
