1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,100
I won't work overtime today

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,100
Episode 3

3
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,180
He Jiaojiao

4
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,340
Why is this coffee so strong

5
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,820
Sister Jing

6
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,260
I'm following

7
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,260
Made it to your own taste

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,420
If you're not used to it

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,940
Then I'll make you another cup

10
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,100
All right, all right

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,820
You go back

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,380
Capable, right

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,900
Sister Jing didn't make any trouble for you today

14
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,540
I'm holding it back

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,660
Coming soon

16
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,780
Du Xiaosong

17
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,340
What are you doing in a daze

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,460
I didn't ask you to move that far

19
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,380
You come back here

20
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,220
I asked you to move to

21
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,380
He Jiaojiao's position

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,380
You move back to me

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,700
My mother called me to dinner at home

24
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,420
Sister Jing

25
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,900
Do you have any arrangements

26
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,980
You did a good job yesterday

27
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,420
I'll give you one today

28
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,060
More valuable learning opportunities

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,140
This is our company

30
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,500
Customer information for the past two years

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,900
You sort it out

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,100
By the way, get familiar with the company's business

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,220
OK

34
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,780
By the way

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,820
Time is still the same

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,980
Give it to me tomorrow

37
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,380
No problem

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,100
This is too bullying, isn't it

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,180
Director Wu didn't give it to her

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,500
A month's worth of work

41
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,420
She actually let someone else

42
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,460
It will be done tonight

43
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,020
See others are interns

44
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,100
Easy to bully

45
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,260
In traditional drama episodes

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,860
Or she can live to forty episodes

47
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,660
But we only have twelve episodes

48
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,100
Time is tight and tasks are heavy

49
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
She can't make waves again

50
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,220
When will the moon come?

51
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
Studying overnight last night

52
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,900
Actually fell asleep

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,580
However, according to

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,900
My observations from the previous two days

55
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,740
This point

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,740
Should be coming soon

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,980
Emperor

58
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,100
You

59
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,260
A man singing here

60
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,260
You

61
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,980
Working overtime here alone

62
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,380
What's wrong

63
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,260
Be wronged

64
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,900
No

65
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,220
Not wronged

66
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,500
It's Sister Jing, the senior of our department

67
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,020
Let me sort out the client profile

68
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,740
I think this is a

69
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,140
Particularly good learning opportunities

70
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,780
So I stayed and worked overtime

71
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,220
Customer Information

72
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,260
Yeah, yeah

73
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,180
These customer information

74
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,300
It is our company in the past few years

75
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,420
All customer information

76
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,420
I heard that the average person

77
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,140
Can't even see it

78
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,100
I feel like it's a big deal for me

79
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,980
That's a great help

80
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,980
Customer Information

81
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,420
Is a company

82
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,020
The most core and confidential resources

83
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,780
They actually

84
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,460
Assign you an intern

85
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,220
To sort out

86
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,140
I can't watch it, can I

87
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Li

88
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,340
I'm my fault

89
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,540
Don't blame Sister Jing

90
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,020
It's okay

91
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,180
Don't blame you

92
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,420
It's getting late

93
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,020
Pack up your things and get off work

94
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,700
Here is the command

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,460
Good

96
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,180
Let's go

97
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,340
I'll go down with you

98
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,260
Where do you live

99
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,260
Let me ask the driver to drop you back on the way

100
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,740
No need, Mr. Li

101
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,340
My family lives in the front building

102
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,980
I'm leaving first bye bye

103
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,700
By the way, Mr. Li

104
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,500
See you tomorrow

105
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,340
By the way

106
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,380
What's your name

107
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,100
I'm just an unknown

108
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,020
Little intern

109
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,260
The servant is just an unknown

110
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,060
Little palace maid

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,180
It's getting late

112
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,820
Not as good as

113
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,620
Follow me back to the bedroom

114
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,820
The slave did not dare

115
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,380
I'll take my leave first

116
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,940
Emperor

117
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,900
Do you need a slave to help you

118
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,100
Look it up

119
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,060
Which palace is she a maid-in-waiting

120
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,700
Notify

121
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,020
Anyone in the future

122
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,900
Then put your own work

123
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Push it to an intern

124
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,820
Direct dismissal

125
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,180
Although this is not as good as the ones in the palace

126
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,340
But it's okay

127
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,020
You're quite leisurely

128
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,540
Something you're asked to do

129
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,700
Are you done

130
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,060
Sister Jing

131
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,860
It's not that I don't do it

132
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Just

133
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,940
They're all here

134
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,980
Let me say something

135
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,140
And yesterday

136
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,660
Special Assistant Xu specifically conveyed to me

137
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,700
Mr. Li's meaning

138
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,460
Regular employees of our company

139
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,780
It is not allowed to

140
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,940
Own work

141
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,100
Push it to interns

142
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,020
Especially from our company

143
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,580
Collation of confidential documents

144
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Once discovered

145
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,020
All will be dismissed

146
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,740
You guys are so smart

147
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,180
Be responsible for yourself

148
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,100
There are some pots I can't carry

149
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,100
Brother Kai

150
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,020
Please take a look

151
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,060
That

152
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,860
Sister Jing

153
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,620
This is last night's announcement

154
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,940
It's your fault

155
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,500
How is it possible

156
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,140
I'm a little intern

157
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,700
Also

158
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,540
Measure you little shrimp

159
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,820
Can't make any splash either

160
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,460
By the way, there's another thing

161
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,980
Liu Jing

162
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,900
You get ready

163
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,420
Hand it over

164
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,860
What about that company

165
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,700
Assigned to you an important task

166
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,460
Go to Dachuan City to open up the market

167
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,860
What

168
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,540
Isn't that a third-tier city

169
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,700
To Okawa City

170
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,020
Isn't it equivalent to exile

171
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,780
Send it again and refuse to let me

172
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,740
Notice to push jobs to interns

173
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,460
It should have something to do with this

174
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,940
Inseparable

175
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,180
Blame herself for being too arrogant

176
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,860
Bullying interns is a small matter

177
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,300
Leaking secrets is

178
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,500
What he cares about most

179
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,700
Why did you leave?

180
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,820
Don't even know

181
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,660
Still that stupid

182
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,100
Hello everyone

183
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,620
I'm Zhao Ting

184
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,300
We'll be colleagues from now on

185
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,860
I give everyone

186
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Bought some afternoon tea

187
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,420
Too polite, too polite

188
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,540
After everyone is a family

189
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,620
Take it yourself

190
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,540
Hello

191
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,860
Hello you guys

192
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,620
It's you

193
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,020
That

194
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,140
I will later

195
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,300
Will take good care of you

196
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,140
Come

197
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,220
Thank you

198
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,820
Brother Kai

199
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,740
Tingting ah

200
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,580
Why did you come here

201
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,780
Isn't this busy

202
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,540
I kept this just for you

203
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,820
Thank you

204
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,820
After that

205
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,540
I have to rely on you to take care of me

206
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,780
No problem

207
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,580
Thank you

208
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,900
Work hard

209
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,460
Okay

210
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,820
Sister Jing

211
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,220
Think then

212
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I'm still an intern with you

213
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,580
How long has it been

214
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm here to hand over the work with you

215
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,140
I really didn't think of it

216
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,780
I'll be back

217
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,860
That

218
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,300
You come on

219
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,740
Don't be too proud of yourself

220
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Be careful of the waves behind the Yangtze River pushing forward waves

221
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,820
The front wave died on the beach

222
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,180
I won't bother you

223
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,900
I

224
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,260
Be prepared

225
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,980
What to do

226
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,980
Sister Jing just left

227
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,860
Sister Zhao is here

228
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,860
And she just

229
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,820
And glared at me

230
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,420
It's okay

231
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,220
Have me

232
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,060
I won't offend others unless they offend me

233
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,500
If someone offends me

234
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,180
This is my first time

235
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,260
Have a meeting with Mr. Li

236
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
Take a good look at him

237
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,620
You arrange interns

238
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,700
Take minutes of the meeting

239
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,660
That

240
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,940
He Jiaojiao

241
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,620
Then you do it

242
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,700
Sister Jiaojiao is a little unfamiliar

243
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,740
Let me do it

244
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,140
It's okay

245
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,860
Brother Kai

246
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,780
Look, now the interns

247
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,220
Even originally belonged to

248
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,500
Their own work

249
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,700
I don't want to do it anymore

250
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm already doing

251
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,540
We can

252
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,780
Record it with your mobile phone

253
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,220
It's okay to type slowly

254
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,180
Mr. Li's meeting

255
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,540
But it's all confidential

256
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,900
You said recording

257
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,820
Then when the time comes

258
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,260
These recordings went out

259
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,860
What can I do

260
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,700
Brother Kai

261
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,220
Do you think it is

262
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,700
I said you interns

263
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,860
Why are there so many problems

264
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,380
Do it if you can

265
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,340
Can't resign yourself

266
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,660
It's okay

267
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,580
Everyone get ready

268
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,420
There's going to be a meeting

269
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,380
Mr. Li

270
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,060
Mr. Li, everyone is here

271
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,900
It's ready to start

272
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,500
After last year's hard work

273
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,340
The company's business has covered the whole country

274
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,660
One thousand forty-two cities

275
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,980
And successfully expanded

276
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,780
Overseas operations

277
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,140
The overall output value has increased

278
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,820
One hundred and ninety-three and seventy-two percent

279
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,740
Keep up the good work, everyone

280
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,700
Pretty handsome

281
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,340
Director Wu

282
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,260
You put the last project

283
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,140
Continue to report

284
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,060
Our entire center last month

285
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,020
Relatively good

286
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,060
What about my three projects

287
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,660
Already entered

288
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,260
Very good results in January this year

289
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,900
Very depressed

290
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,220
So ask the boss to give us

291
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,340
That's all for today's meeting

292
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,420
Adjourned the meeting

293
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,980
Brother Kai

294
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,020
Mr. Li said so much

295
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,820
She only remembered two lines

296
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,020
Is there any intention

297
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,460
Before going to work tomorrow

298
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,300
I can't keep it

299
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,380
Words from the minutes of the meeting

300
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,940
Regular application

301
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,340
Never try to pass

302
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,500
Be careful

303
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,420
No recording

304
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,500
How to hand in the minutes of the meeting

305
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,900
Do you treat people as stenographers

306
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,060
That sister Zhao Ting is really

307
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,500
Looks smiling on the surface

308
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,980
Actually deliberately embarrassing people

309
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,860
Is much smarter than before

310
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,620
But that's

311
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,740
Just being clever

312
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,700
Sister Jiaojiao

313
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,220
You must become a full-time and show it to them

314
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,340
I've also remembered some

315
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,380
Let me do it for you

316
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,380
After last year's hard work

317
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,140
Our Company's Business

318
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,100
Has expanded across the country

319
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,500
One thousand forty-two cities

320
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,780
And expanded overseas business

321
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,860
The overall output value has increased

322
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,900
One hundred and ninety-three point seventy-two

323
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,700
You remember it all

324
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,580
Don't miss a word

325
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Bold bitch

326
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,260
How dare to deduct

327
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,300
Our Empress's monthly salary

328
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,260
You must have stolen it

329
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,300
I

330
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,460
Still want to quibble

331
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,900
Give me a call

332
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,220
Let me see which one of you dares to touch me

333
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,380
Dare to touch me

334
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,340
No one has good fruit to eat

335
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,620
Last month at three quarters afternoon on the second day of the lunar month

336
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,220
You and the other palace maid Xiao Yun

337
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,500
Come together to receive the service

338
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,580
Last month at twelve at twenty quarter afternoon

339
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,700
Here you go again

340
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,860
What you were wearing that day

341
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,060
Green clothes

342
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,340
Wearing a red head flower

343
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,740
Your exact words are

344
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,580
There's an emergency in your mother's house

345
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,460
So I want to make an advance

346
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,860
Next month's service

347
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,300
Every account I have here

348
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,020
Remember all clearly

349
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,140
And there are account books to prove it

350
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,820
Don't you dare to say that I deducted it

351
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,060
Your lady's service

352
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,180
I

353
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,460
I see the deduction

354
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,420
Someone your lady serves

355
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,300
Is it you

356
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,980
You spit your mouth

357
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,540
You still don't do anything

358
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,700
Let go

359
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,460
The imperial edict arrives

360
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,340
Which one of you is He Mingyue

361
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,220
You're the one who's

362
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,780
Kunqu Opera sung in the Imperial Garden

363
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,780
Yes

364
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,700
He Mingyue received the decree

365
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,260
Fengtian carries the emperor's imperial edict saying

366
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,780
Ho's Mingyue

367
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,380
Beautiful temperament

368
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,900
Gentle and obedient

369
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,740
Make him a noble person

370
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,620
I admire this

371
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,500
Thank you, Your Majesty

372
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,740
If you don't remember this

373
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,300
How do you get around in the harem

374
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,900
Sister Jiaojiao

375
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,260
You're talking nonsense again

376
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,460
Done

377
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,300
You leave me alone

378
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,100
You should go back to work
