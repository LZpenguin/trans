1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,060
I won't work overtime today

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,940
Episode 5

3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,620
Fresh graduates

4
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,500
And work experience

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,420
Only one-year-old ones have

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,420
Two hundred and two copies

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,420
This information

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,100
I have synced to

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,060
Everyone's computers

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,260
Any other questions

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,100
Very good

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,500
Would you like to sit down first

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,260
According to this data

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,180
Recruitment of new people

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,420
Can't keep up with company expansion

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,420
Increased efforts are needed

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,820
Give me a plan within a week

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,100
Additionally

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,700
Director Wu

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,140
Personnel Department Work

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,140
What is most important

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,540
Knowing people well

23
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,740
Clear rewards and punishments

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,860
Very good

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,100
Adjourned the meeting

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,460
Everyone can go back to work

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,140
Well done

28
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,060
Brother Kai

29
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,980
You see how proud she is

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,060
Let's go

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,100
Sister Jiaojiao

32
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,740
You're too good, aren't you

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,820
Those data

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,620
How do you know

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,140
You're not making this up, are you

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,100
How is it possible

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,820
Li Su has that kind of computing power

38
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,780
How could I make this up

39
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,220
Then you were ready before

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,900
Yes

41
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,740
Neither is it

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,540
I didn't know there was a meeting

43
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,100
So there isn't

44
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,460
Make arrangements for meetings

45
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,260
But last month

46
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,940
We've been putting together resumes

47
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,580
Zhao Ting has been asking me to work overtime

48
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,660
So I just dropped the way

49
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,020
Have made all these data

50
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,820
I finally understood

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,300
Why did you say

52
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,620
Do everything you can do well

53
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,980
Jiaojiao is back

54
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,980
Congratulations

55
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,020
This time finally

56
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,620
He showed his face in front of Mr. Li

57
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,900
I think you must

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,460
It's been carefully prepared for a long time

59
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,820
You're so good

60
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,620
You look like

61
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,980
We regular employees

62
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,460
Can't even compare to you

63
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,380
Where

64
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,660
Sister Ting, you are better

65
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,420
It's just

66
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,300
After you finish your work

67
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,260
But remember

68
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,940
Report to your superiors

69
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,740
Otherwise, you will leapfrog and report it like you do

70
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,860
Those who know know you're serious

71
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,100
Someone who doesn't know

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,300
I thought you were scheming

73
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,420
Trying to frame someone else

74
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,020
But it's okay

75
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,540
My lord has a large number of

76
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,340
I won't argue with you this time

77
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,020
Sister Ting

78
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,820
These data

79
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,340
I'm

80
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,020
I've reported it to you

81
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,540
Don't put your thoughts

82
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,100
Is it okay to put it on someone else's head

83
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,660
What

84
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,820
When did you report

85
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,460
Take a look at the WeChat file

86
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,180
It's full of my data

87
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,940
Or didn't you watch it at all

88
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,980
Of course I did

89
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,300
Just such important data

90
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,300
You have to remind me more

91
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,380
Sister Ting

92
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,100
Take a look at WeChat again

93
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,460
I've called you so many times

94
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,900
Isn't it just to remind you

95
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,660
Anyone who knows

96
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,820
Know you're busy

97
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,020
People who don't know

98
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,060
I thought

99
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,300
Are you not serious in your work

100
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,180
You

101
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,380
Don't talk nonsense

102
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,620
What are you doing

103
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,300
Brother Kai

104
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,060
Here's what it looks like

105
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,100
Today, Jiaojiao is indeed

106
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,660
Leapfrog directly to the leader

107
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,860
Reported the work

108
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,580
But her performance

109
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,980
It is also very prominent

110
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,500
I was thinking

111
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,980
Is it possible

112
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,820
Put your resume on this piece of work

113
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,460
Leave it to her

114
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,660
You really think so

115
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,340
And Mr. Li today

116
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,220
Very satisfied indeed

117
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,420
Bright performance

118
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,380
As long as she finishes her work later

119
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,620
Report to me in a timely manner

120
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,860
That's all right

121
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,300
Or do you know the big picture?

122
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,340
But later

123
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,740
And she doesn't have to report to you

124
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,300
Jiaojiao

125
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,220
Mr. Wu told me

126
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,220
What about tomorrow

127
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,340
You bring your information

128
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,100
Go through the formal entry formalities

129
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,380
And then what

130
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,660
You two hand over the procedure

131
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,620
What about the future

132
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,540
You're in charge of her business

133
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,500
You

134
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,260
You said she became a full-time employee ahead of schedule

135
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,500
Yeah

136
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,340
Didn't you also say

137
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,540
Did she perform well

138
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,260
I

139
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,780
By the way, that one

140
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,780
Have some snacks at the handover

141
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,140
Don't give me any more trouble

142
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,700
Brother Kai

143
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,580
Your position

144
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,380
Not as good as here

145
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,620
You don't know

146
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,740
Since the establishment of our company

147
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,060
Only three people became full-time ahead of schedule

148
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,220
What a wonderful thing

149
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,100
It's not as simple as you think

150
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,500
But there's nothing difficult

151
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,460
I'm leaving first

152
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Wait for me, I'll go too

153
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,940
Don't you work overtime

154
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,740
It's all done

155
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,180
You don't have to work overtime

156
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,020
Let's go

157
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,380
Pick me up downstairs in five minutes

158
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,060
Come back after a while

159
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,020
I'll contact you later

160
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,180
He Jiaojiao

161
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,780
Come over

162
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,020
Come over

163
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,140
That's how you treat it

164
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,300
The boss who just turned you full-time

165
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,340
Morning boss

166
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,100
Thank you boss

167
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,140
As soon as I turned you into a full-time person, you drifted away

168
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,220
I didn't even work overtime last night

169
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,980
I've finished my work

170
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,180
I'll decide later

171
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,100
During working hours

172
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,260
Get all the tasks done

173
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,060
I believe

174
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,060
This is also your boss

175
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,260
The scene I want to see most

176
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,380
Is the work done

177
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,940
Or are you deliberately avoiding me

178
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,540
Are you playing hard to get for me

179
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,900
How could it be

180
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,100
I have always respected you

181
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,060
Really

182
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,860
Then you

183
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,780
The boss

184
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,820
Please wait for the elevator

185
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,700
I went to climb the stairs first

186
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,060
Work in a hurry, bye-bye

187
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,100
I also climb stairs to exercise

188
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,180
Dear Ladies

189
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,260
I just went out to do some errands

190
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,020
Then I passed a dessert shop

191
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,620
I think they have quite a lot of family members

192
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,540
So I'll give it to everyone

193
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,580
Bought some afternoon tea

194
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,140
Thank you

195
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,820
Everyone has it

196
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,580
Come on to you

197
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,140
Thank you

198
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,060
Sister Yu, hold it steady

199
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,340
Thank you

200
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,060
Lai Jiaojiao

201
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,460
Why is there one missing

202
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,220
I obviously bought it according to the head

203
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,500
Did the clerk give the wrong count

204
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,540
I'm sorry, Jiaojiao

205
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,780
I

206
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,820
I may have forgotten about you

207
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,260
Let's do this

208
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,340
Why don't I give you this

209
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,740
Thank you, Sister Ting

210
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,380
I like cake best

211
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,060
Thank you

212
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,060
This

213
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,100
Why don't you forget it

214
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,300
What about me

215
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,340
Losing weight recently

216
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,260
This cake

217
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,020
It's also high in calories and sugar

218
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,420
I still don't eat it

219
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,740
But I think Sister Ting

220
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,420
Your figure is pretty well managed

221
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,860
Should usually

222
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Don't eat these things

223
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,020
I

224
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,740
Give me a minute

225
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,820
You all eat

226
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,300
What are you doing

227
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,060
Sneaky

228
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,780
Frontline News

229
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,780
That Zhao Ting

230
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,700
Created a WeChat group

231
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Say bad things about you in there

232
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,140
There is really one

233
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,500
Newly opened paella

234
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,780
Do you want to give it a try

235
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,900
There are group purchase coupons

236
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,980
Yeah

237
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,900
Then go to us

238
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
Clockwork link in the group

239
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,820
WeChat Group

240
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,060
What is WeChat Group

241
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,220
Isn't it five women and eight groups

242
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,540
You won't be isolated from an early age

243
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,700
Have you never been in a group chat

244
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,660
It doesn't matter

245
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,140
Anyway, that

246
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,420
How to play the combination of WeChat group

247
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,180
There are many kinds of things

248
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,820
In short, it's a sentence summary

249
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,980
The hearts of the people behind the scenes are not old

250
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:54,940
Unexpectedly

251
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,380
She's a little palace maid

252
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,460
He actually jumped to the position of concubine

253
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,060
On an equal footing with us

254
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,460
Don't say that

255
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,140
You don't know

256
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,740
Who are they trying to win over

257
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,220
I'm afraid of her

258
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,980
I'd like to see

259
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,540
How long can she be proud

260
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,020
That is

261
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,020
Just a little palace maid

262
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,700
Is it possible that you really want to become a phoenix

263
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Let me see

264
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,060
Everyone should be careful

265
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,060
Everyone has a little more thought in it

266
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,300
Be on guard against her

267
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,220
Don't be bewitched by her

268
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,540
Mingyue, please say hello to all sisters

269
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Everyone is here

270
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,220
He Bin

271
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,540
It's you today

272
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,020
The first day of being promoted to the rank of concubine

273
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,980
Don't restrain yourself

274
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,020
Come

275
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,820
Enjoy the flowers with me

276
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,260
This human heart has never been old

277
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,700
But it's a different carrier

278
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,020
Just doing the same thing

279
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,140
Maybe they have other groups

280
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,700
Specifically speaking ill of Zhao Ting

281
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,220
One more thing

282
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,580
Don't know

283
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,460
Say

284
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,340
That's what they're passing right now

285
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,460
You went through the back door when you turned full-time ahead of time

286
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,300
Why don't you clarify

287
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,660
Let them be

288
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,500
Strength is

289
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,940
The best way to clear up rumors

290
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,700
Get back to work

291
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,380
Wait a minute, there's one more thing

292
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,620
What is it

293
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,220
That is, they still pass on

294
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,940
The two of us have an affair

295
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,380
Have an affair

296
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,140
What is having an affair

297
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,340
Having an affair is

298
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,620
You like me I like you

299
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,060
I didn't expect that

300
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,380
Of course

301
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,180
I like you best

302
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,460
Such a cute brother

303
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,500
Let's go

304
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,660
Mr. Li, I've packed everything

305
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,140
I'll go this way

306
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,860
Why don't you first

307
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,860
Mr. Li, who provoked you? This is

308
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,060
Let me ask you

309
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,420
Our company

310
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,700
Which position is the most bitter and tiring

311
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,100
Assistant to the President

312
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,740
No, no, no, no

313
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,420
That, that, I'm kidding

314
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,900
I'm not trying to help you

315
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,420
Let's live up the atmosphere

316
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,620
Who's messing with you again

317
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,900
I remember Mr. Wei

318
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,700
Isn't it to open up the market overseas

319
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,180
Why don't you ask her

320
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,420
Look at it in Africa

321
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,940
Is there any hard work in mining?

322
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,260
Not bad, it's a place to go

323
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,540
You go and check it out

324
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,980
OK

325
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,740
Xu Tezhu

326
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,420
What happened to Mr. Li recently

327
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,540
I don't think he's in a good mood

328
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,580
You want to know

329
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
I still want to know

330
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,740
I eat them all if I don't see them

331
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Quick-acting Jiuxin Pill helped me

332
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,300
Looks like I have to hurry to the meeting

333
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,460
Ask them for it

334
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,500
New recruitment plan

335
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,660
You wait, wait, wait

336
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,860
Help me analyze it

337
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,820
Who the hell provoked Mr. Li

338
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,940
He he

339
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,180
It's not her

340
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,020
Who knows

341
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,620
Sister Jiaojiao

342
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,460
Why are you still here

343
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,020
Where else should I be

344
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,740
You didn't talk to them

345
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,500
Are you going to the meeting together

346
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,820
Have a meeting

347
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,100
I didn't see you just now

348
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,380
I thought you were there

349
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,900
Several of their regular employees

350
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,020
Said the director called a meeting

351
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,900
Talk about discussing the plan

352
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,500
These people can

353
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,940
To isolate me

354
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,260
Don't even call me for meetings

355
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,420
Delay work

356
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
Can they afford to be responsible

357
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,020
That

358
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,220
So what if they've already gone

359
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,420
It's okay, I have my own way

360
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,900
Has anyone asked for leave of absence

361
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,740
Chief inspector

362
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,580
No request for leave was received

363
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,740
Then this is

364
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,900
He Jiaojiao

365
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,900
She may have overslept

366
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,900
It's four o'clock in the afternoon and I'm still asleep

367
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,100
Is it the newly turned full-time, right?

368
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,900
Right

369
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
It floated on the first day of becoming a full-time employee
