1
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:26,880
Our palace is not working overtime today

2
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,920
Episode I

3
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:42,499
This is Sister Li's file

4
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,791
Super copied documents

5
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,374
Sister Jing's Sister Jing's

6
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:10,848
Have you eaten yet

7
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:12,544
Don't be too tired at the beginning of work

8
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:17,504
Take Good Care of Yourself

9
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:23,136
Okay, Dad, I'm going to sleep.

10
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,041
He's Mingyue

11
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,500
Wen Wan Shu De

12
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,375
Elegant and dignified

13
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,250
Queen He Queen He


14
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,958
For the Mother of the World

15
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:55,968
The Emperor

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,536
Xu Gonggong

17
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,166
A little palace maid at the beginning

18
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,375
Quiet concubine Quiet concubine


19
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,916
I knew this earlier

20
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,000
When she knelt down and begged for mercy

21
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,875
I should have taken care of her

22
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,083
How could the emperor be blinded by her

23
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,625
I'm obsessed

24
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,291
Zhao Bin Zhao Bin


25
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,083
How can she compare with Wei Guifei

26
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,166
Wei Guifei Wei Guifei


27
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,416
The Emperor spoils you now

28
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:36,791
And you can guarantee

29
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,333
How long is this love

30
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:45,958
Small pine nuts

31
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,166
Reply to the mother's words

32
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,541
Little Songzi father-in-law has something to do temporarily

33
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,583
Let me help you

34
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,499
This little maid is too courageous

35
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,249
Didn't she rely on this trick at the beginning?

36
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,624
Seducing the Emperor

37
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:02,499
Come

38
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,208
Called the Imperial Doctor

39
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,458
Xuanmaoyi Quick Xuanmaoyi

40
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:06,791
Emperor

41
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,624
Now it's my canonization

42
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,208
How about first

43
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,208
The little beauty fainted

44
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,416
Is the ceremony important or human life important?

45
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,124
Queen

46
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,124
I didn't expect

47
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:14,458
You're a selfish man

48
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:15,958
How can you be a mother of the world like this?

49
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,041
I was so disappointed by this

50
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,249
What about the imperial doctor

51
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,166
What is Xiao Xuzi doing in a daze

52
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:20,999
It's not called imperial medicine yet

53
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,749
The emperor has sent for it

54
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,624
Even if I became a queen

55
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:30,208
And he's still

56
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,541
See one and love one

57
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,166
My whole life

58
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:37,958
After all, it was a wrong payment

59
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:57,958
Poison wine

60
00:03:58,874 --> 00:03:59,874
White silk

61
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,416
Could the emperor have

62
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,999
Because of the event of the Great Ceremony of the Dynasty

63
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:05,499
To die

64
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,249
I am the empress of the dynasty

65
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,499
Sleeping soundly

66
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,816
Liu Jing

67
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,648
Quiet concubine

68
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:13,916
Liu Jing Liu Jing


69
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:14,458
Still here

70
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,791
What are you daydreaming about

71
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:17,499
Go

72
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,041
I took this document for a photocopy

73
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,708
What kind of dream did this palace have

74
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:29,208
He Jiaojiao, you are quite deep in the play

75
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,416
There's this drama queen time

76
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,124
Hurry up and go

77
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:32,874
I took the document and made a copy

78
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,208
You're just a quiet concubine

79
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,166
You dare to shout at me

80
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,416
He Jiaojiao, are you crazy?

81
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:43,958
Believe or not this palace

82
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,374
Put you in the cold

83
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,333
You're a little intern

84
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,041
Early in the morning here

85
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:50,791
What the hell is going on

86
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,916
Want to dry and don't want to roll

87
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,499
Sister Jing, are you all right

88
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,541
You calm down first

89
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,291
He Jiaojiao

90
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,749
Why don't you apologize to Sister Jing?

91
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:00,874
Isn't this a dream

92
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,083
And at this point my identity

93
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,374
Lower than a quiet concubine

94
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:09,166
Sister Jing, I'm kidding

95
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,041
That copy, right?

96
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,708
I'm going

97
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,708
Three, please

98
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,666
And this

99
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,208
People here are really lazy

100
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,583
Even the strokes are simplified

101
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,833
Complex

102
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,125
Seal

103
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:35,708
Chamber

104
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,958
How to use it?

105
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:01,754
Du Xiaosong.

106
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:03,333
Du Gonggong

107
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,291
Du Xiaosong. Du Xiaosong.


108
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,541
What are you doing here

109
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,083
You are;

110
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,833
That crazy, grumpy intern

111
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,041
Why, why are you looking at me like that

112
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,208
This hair

113
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,375
I'm sorry I'm sorry

114
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,250
This is a new skirt that I just bought

115
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,416
Zhao Ting. Zhao Ting.


116
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,008
Zhao Bin

117
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,340
Zhao Ting.

118
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,166
What to do

119
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:37,541
I'm sorry

120
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,750
I didn't mean to

121
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,791
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

122
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,541
The minions knew they were wrong

123
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,708
The minions don't dare anymore

124
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,666
This is the palace

125
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,750
For the Queen Mother's birthday banquet

126
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,375
Clothes specially tailored by the embroidery workshop

127
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,750
Just like this, you're a little eunuch

128
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,708
Get dirty

129
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,375
Somebody drag it down

130
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,833
Break his hand for me

131
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,625
Intern

132
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,958
You don't have eyes

133
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:58,833
To see someone pass by

134
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,958
You're still there

135
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,000
You are wood;

136
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,416
I help you

137
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,583
Don't you touch me

138
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,000
Just your shitty salary

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,375
Can you afford my skirt

140
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,625
The skirt is really nice

141
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,208
Too bad

142
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,291
That's a good thing you said

143
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,583
That

144
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,000
Dry cleaning fee

145
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,500
Give it to me

146
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,208
Wait a minute

147
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,500
How can I see

148
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,583
You hit him

149
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,208
Co-authored by two interns

150
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,125
Hold together

151
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,291
To bully me as a regular employee

152
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,375
You think

153
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,333
Am I afraid of you

154
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,166
Anyway, today's skirt

155
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,208
Someone must be responsible

156
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,666
Empress

157
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,541
Please spare him

158
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,583
What the hell are you

159
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,625
Do you have a word for this round

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,333
The maidservant asked you to spare him

161
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,500
It's for your own good

162
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,750
Today is the Queen Mother's birthday feast

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,208
The Queen Mother has worshiped Buddha for many years

164
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,916
If I saw blood today

165
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,958
Not very well, I'm afraid

166
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,750
There is some truth to what you say

167
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,833
But my clothes

168
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:14,791
Empress

169
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,875
A slave has a family trade

170
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,791
Let the maidservant give you a try

171
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,583
Look, my lady

172
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,625
It's not too bad

173
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,458
It's getting late

174
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,166
This palace is going to the Palace of Compassion and Ning

175
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,041
Get out of the way

176
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,416
This is a slave

177
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,583
The way it should be

178
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:50,708
But you

179
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,666
Crash the master first

180
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,416
Don't think that some little trick

181
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,541
You can cancel out

182
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,416
If you are really responsible

183
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,916
It's not his turn

184
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,000
What do you mean

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,583
You;

186
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,583
Look

187
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,875
Code of Practice for the Management of Copy Rooms Article 3

188
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,333
Prohibition of food

189
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,791
Beverages

190
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:14,916
Beverages brought in

191
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,458
Lest cause

192
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:17,500
Machine

193
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,708
Machine breakage

194
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:20,958
What is this

195
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,666
Don't take this thing

196
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,625
To scare me

197
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,083
Up and down the company

198
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,041
People who eat and drink here

199
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:26,708
Too much to go

200
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,625
I'm not the only one

201
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,458
Is it

202
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,666
It really seems like you're the only one

203
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,333
Look what I'm doing

204
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,000
Remember a sentence

205
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,750
Be forgiven and forgive

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,875
Why not do this today

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,833
Just let it go

208
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,041
He Jiaojiao, right?

209
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:50,958
I remember you

210
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,083
Heaven reaps the wicked

211
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,875
If the sky doesn't accept it, I will accept it

212
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,666
Sister Mingyue, what do you mean

213
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,083
I put honey on her

214
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,291
Today is the Queen Mother's birthday

215
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,791
I see what she should do

216
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:23,041
Five four three two one

217
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,541
He Mingyue

218
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,374
You are too powerful

219
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:35,166
If it hadn't been for you

220
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,583
I'm really going to lose her money

221
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,499
Don't be afraid of her

222
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:39,291
Zhao Pin, this man

223
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,458
It is to bully the weak and fear the hard

224
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,874
In fact, it is very vulnerable

225
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:44,708
Zhao Bin

226
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:46,041
This

227
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,499
Where is this accent

228
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,416
Zhao Ting

229
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,583
By the way, what am I supposed to call you

230
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,249
Empress

231
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:03,166
Joking

232
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,916
You just call me

233
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,416
Sister Jiaojiao

234
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:08,916
We're not sure

235
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:09,916
Who is bigger than the other

236
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,208
Whoa, whoa

237
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,666
Okay, Sister Jiaojiao

238
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:19,291
Right

239
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,833
I have a question for you

240
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,166

00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:32,749
Cool

00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,874
You mean our company is great

244
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:38,333
Right

245
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,208
Since our new president, Li Su

00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,291
After taking office

247
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,499

President

258
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,999
It is the top level of this company.

259
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,499
All the powers of life and death

260
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:09,624
It's all in his hands

261
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,916

Now that it's all over again

Follow the script

265
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,749
Screenwriter, you're naive

266
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:21,833
I want to have a good time

267
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:27,291
Sister, what are you doing

268
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,208
Where were we?

269
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,874
Yes, set it a small goal first

Be a company president for fun

271
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:40,666

I didn't expect

282
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,416
You're a selfish man

283
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:45,624
This dead man

284
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,666
Still hooking up around now

285
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,374

The palace gets used to it in a second

You don't have to be polite You don't have to be polite
