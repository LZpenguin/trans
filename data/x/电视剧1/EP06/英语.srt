1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,100
I won't work overtime today

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,100
Episode 6

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,460
Director Wu

4
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,780
I'm sorry

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm late

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,940
He Jiaojiao

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,780
How did you arrive

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,740
But everyone doesn't want it either

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,020
Blame her too much

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,940
After all, she just became a full-time

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,300
Late

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,140
And it's not what

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,580
An unforgivable thing

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,500
As long as next time

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,780
Just don't do it again

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:50,980
Director Wu

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,460
I know today is a seminar

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,700
So I just follow

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,940
All the information of the company in previous years

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,980
I made a copy for everyone

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,500
But the printer is broken

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
So I'm late

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,340
This is your information

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,060
It's okay

25
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,980
You are very thoughtful

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,820
Very good

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,660
Thank you

28
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,100
Just come

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,700
Why is there one missing

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,740
I'm sorry

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,380
Everyone

32
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
I copied it per head

33
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,140
Maybe it was careless

34
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,580
I'm sorry, Sister Ting

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,340
Without yours

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,940
Why is there one missing

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,940
I obviously bought it according to the head

38
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,820
I may have forgotten about you

39
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,500
It's okay

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,180
You two read a copy together

41
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,340
Come

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,940
Let's start the discussion now

43
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,860
So hungry

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,060
Bingbing

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,340
Didn't you have breakfast

46
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,260
Would you like to try two pieces

47
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,580
I made my own Poria cocos cake

48
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,740
Do the math

49
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,180
You can eat when you are asked to eat

50
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,020
Don't talk nonsense

51
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,460
How about it

52
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,700
This dish is really delicious

53
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,460
You did it

54
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,980
It's really delicious

55
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,780
As long as it tastes good

56
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,140
What about me

57
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,780
Learned before

58
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,980
A little bit of traditional Chinese medicine

59
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,620
Know a little about acupuncture points

60
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,540
Do you want me to press it for you

61
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,540
Real or false

62
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,460
Xu Chao, sit down, sit down

63
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,420
It won't work if you click it lightly

64
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,740
Switch sides, switch sides

65
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,900
Little Master

66
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,580
Whether it is massage technique

67
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,900
Or is it the art of documents?

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,500
Not in the palace

69
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,020
Are there imperial doctors and cooks

70
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,540
If you have too many skills, you don't weigh yourself

71
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,100
Learning more is never a bad thing

72
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,820
Sister Li

73
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,460
I'll give it to you again

74
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,540
Recommend cosmetics

75
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,980
How about it

76
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,620
Good

77
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,060
-What lipstick number -What lipstick number

78
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,420
I bought milk tea for everyone

79
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,980
Give him back in his way

80
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,340
How about this trick

81
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,540
Five women, eight groups

82
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,900
This is really an unspoken rule in the workplace

83
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,140
He Jiaojiao, stop

84
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,940
What is it

85
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,660
Are you spreading rumors about me

86
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,740
I warn you

87
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,980
Show some respect to your seniors

88
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,700
How

89
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,820
Stop pretending

90
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,860
Want respect, don't you

91
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,100
Do you think about your usual

92
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,660
All the things you did, all the things you did

93
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,500
What is the matter

94
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,980
Is worthy of my respect

95
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,300
Respect is about ability

96
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,380
Not seniority

97
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,260
He Jiaojiao

98
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,100
I'm going to educate you today

99
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,500
Tell you what a junior is

100
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,740
Let me educate you

101
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,260
What do you usually do

102
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,260
Forget it

103
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,820
But because of this

104
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Delay my work

105
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,700
Don't blame me for being rude

106
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,260
You

107
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,740
You

108
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,060
You

109
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,700
You just became a full-time

110
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,860
You're doing this to me

111
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,620
You've gone too far

112
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,900
Get up

113
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,460
Mr. Li

114
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,300
You can go back first

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,420
It's working hours now

116
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,180
Thank you, Mr. Li

117
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,940
He Jiaojiao

118
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,020
You stay

119
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,700
The little beauty fainted

120
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,900
Is the ceremony more important or human life more important?

121
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,620
Empress

122
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,660
I didn't expect

123
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,940
You are a self-serving person

124
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,580
How can you be like this? How can you be so impressed with the world

125
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,780
I'm so disappointed by this

126
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,780
Is there anything else going on, Mr. Li

127
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,060
Did you just

128
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,580
How

129
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,980
Blame me again

130
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,900
I'm not

131
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,020
I just saw

132
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,100
I feel sorry for her again

133
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,820
Our President

134
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,180
It's really fraternity

135
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,020
What the hell are you talking about

136
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,900
I just saw her

137
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,780
Yeah, what you saw was right

138
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,420
I am

139
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,500
A person who likes to bully others

140
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
A self-serving person

141
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,460
If you don't think you can

142
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,420
You can fire me

143
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,100
He Jiaojiao, what are you doing

144
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,740
If you don't want to fire me

145
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,260
Then I'll go back to work first

146
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,140
What are you doing

147
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,340
So unaware of what's good or what's bad

148
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,940
Sooner or later I'll take you

149
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,780
You feel free to

150
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:20,820
This woman

151
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,260
Why don't you listen to me

152
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,780
Mr. Li

153
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,940
Why is it so slow

154
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,380
Just a sound

155
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,820
Don't make excuses at work

156
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,220
I was wrong, Mr. Li

157
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,860
Mr. Li, what are your orders

158
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,780
You go and arrange for Ho Jiaokjiao from the personnel department

159
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,940
Send me the information

160
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,220
Now

161
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,500
Immediately

162
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,180
Immediately

163
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,260
What what what information

164
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,100
Casually

165
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,780
What's wrong with him

166
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,860
Personnel Department He Jiaojiao

167
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,500
Jiaojiao

168
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,380
Put this

169
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,700
Send it to General Manager Li's office

170
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,380
That

171
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,100
Brother Kai

172
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,820
My recruitment plan

173
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,500
Not finished yet

174
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,540
I just got some idea

175
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,220
Otherwise I

176
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,940
What thinking is not thinking

177
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,980
The leader will arrange some work for you

178
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,460
Why are you so picky

179
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,300
Leadership's instructions

180
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,900
Is your highest order

181
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,300
Go ahead

182
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,940
Good

183
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,940
Du Xiaosong

184
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,540
I finally found you

185
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,940
Do me a favor

186
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,460
Put this

187
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,860
Send it to the president's office

188
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,020
Why don't you send it yourself

189
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,340
If you ask you to send it, you will send it

190
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,540
Where's so much nonsense

191
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,180
Are you worried

192
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,220
I'm afraid of meeting Mr. Li changing clothes

193
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,220
Go quickly

194
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,620
Let me see

195
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,020
What happened to the promise

196
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,900
Ask He Jiaojiao to send a document

197
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,740
It's gonna take so long

198
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,900
Still

199
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,620
He Jiaojiao doesn't want to come

200
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,460
Go ahead

201
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,700
All right

202
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,980
Then you help me

203
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,380
Make a copy of this

204
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,020
OK

205
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,140
And this

206
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,380
Come on in

207
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Do you know it's wrong

208
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,380
Yes Yes Yes

209
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:48,860
Mr. Li

210
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
It's all my fault

211
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,140
Who are you

212
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,580
Why are you here

213
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,220
I am

214
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,100
Intern at the Human Resources Center

215
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,860
I came to bring you the documents

216
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,820
He Jiaojiao

217
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Didn't I ask her to come

218
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,860
Sister Jiaojiao

219
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,100
She's not feeling well

220
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,420
Uncomfortable

221
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,860
What's wrong with her

222
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,500
Mr. Li

223
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,660
Not

224
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,940
Mr. Li, where are you going

225
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,460
Mr. Li

226
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,060
What's wrong with you

227
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,860
Why are you uncomfortable

228
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,220
Or I'll take you to the hospital

229
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,780
I have a bit of a headache

230
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,180
But it's okay

231
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,460
I'm almost done

232
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,540
Headache

233
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,700
Do you have a fever

234
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,220
Mr. Li

235
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
This is in the company

236
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,740
You come with me

237
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,820
What's the situation

238
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,380
Am I going to be silenced

239
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,180
Mr. Li, can you let me go

240
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,100
I won't let go

241
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,020
What are you gonna do

242
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,740
Don't stare at me

243
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,780
You glared at me and wouldn't let go

244
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,380
Why don't you listen to me every time

245
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,140
Finish your words

246
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,220
It's always I haven't spoken yet

247
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,860
You're impatient

248
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,660
Then tell me

249
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,420
What are you gonna say

250
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,740
I'm sorry

251
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,820
I'm sorry

252
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,180
He Jiaojiao

253
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,740
Today I was in the hallway

254
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,820
It's all angry words

255
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,420
I've never had

256
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,380
Want to fire you

257
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,980
I've never felt

258
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,020
You are a self-serving person

259
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,180
People who like to bully others

260
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,340
And

261
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,460
Why did you treat me

262
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,300
Hot and cold

263
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,500
What exactly am I doing wrong

264
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,780
Mr. Li, it's not your fault

265
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,860
I'm wrong

266
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,540
I also think

267
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,980
Mainly your problem

268
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,700
But I can forgive you

269
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,260
Please correct it

270
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,580
What I made

271
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,460
Here's your apology

272
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,020
Whether you like to eat or not

273
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
I eat

274
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,540
Who said they wouldn't eat?

275
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,540
You really did it

276
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,100
It's delicious

277
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,740
That's nice

278
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:11,820
Mr. Li

279
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,900
If you don't have anything else to do

280
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,740
I'm leaving first

281
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,220
Don't be angry anymore

282
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,020
Okay, then I'll forgive you, too

283
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,300
Then you can go and do your job first

284
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,420
Actually

285
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,900
You can stay a little longer

286
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,060
He Jiaojiao

287
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,380
Sister Jiaojiao

288
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,180
Are you still not leaving

289
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,700
Let's go

290
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,500
I'll do it tomorrow

291
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,300
Waiting for you

292
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,020
Forget it, you go first

293
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,460
I finished the plan

294
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,980
Could it be that you and Li

295
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,860
Don't talk nonsense

296
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,580
I promise I won't give it away

297
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,460
Your adultery

298
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,900
I'm leaving first

299
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,820
Why are you here

300
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,140
Wait for me

301
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,980
I'll be fine in a minute

302
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,900
Who's waiting for you

303
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,180
I'm leaving

304
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,940
Childish

305
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,260
Aren't you leaving

306
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,340
Why are you back again

307
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,260
It's too dark

308
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,020
I'm afraid of the dark

309
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,540
I need someone down with me

310
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,900
Can you find some

311
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,260
A more careful reason

312
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,700
Here is my company

313
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,140
I can be where I want to be

314
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,540
More childish

315
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,500
You give me that cake today

316
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,300
Is there any more
