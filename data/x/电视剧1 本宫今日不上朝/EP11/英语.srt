[I won't work overtime today]

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,300
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,860
Nice photos

4
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,820
It's still good-looking in real life

5
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,460
It's nice here

6
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,260
So you look up

7
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,980
You can see

8
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
Actually, I think you can

9
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,860
Directly set as computer desktop

10
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,220
Just a little suggestion

11
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,420
What are you doing

12
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,220
Practice how to tie a tie

13
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,980
Tie a tie

14
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,980
Then what do you use these gloves for

15
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,580
Boxing gloves

16
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,380
Sincere gift from the merchant

17
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,100
You can buy it directly

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,900
Mannequin

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,180
You are clearly trying to do this

20
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,940
Mr. Li

21
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,140
Sometimes curiosity is too good

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,060
Not a good thing

23
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,020
He Jiaojiao

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,260
If you were to me

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,980
If you have any comments

26
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,780
You can just come at me

27
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,700
I will never resist

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,580
For example

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,140
You hit me

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,140
I know

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,060
You still feel sorry for me

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,180
You guys are here

33
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,340
Mr. Li's dinner tonight

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,660
I have something else on the horizon

35
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,900
Maybe I won't be able to go with you

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,460
Okay, I got it

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,340
Then I'll go by myself

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,780
Mr. Li of the organizing game this time

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,580
He is a fastidious person

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,340
Make it clear that you want to bring a female companion

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,820
You have to dress formally

42
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,380
You can't go alone

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,540
It's better to let Special Assistant He

44
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,580
Come with you

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,780
Do you think it's suitable

46
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,420
I'd rather

47
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,940
I don't know He Jiaojiao

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,860
Would you like to

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,180
Special Assistant He

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,580
Sister Mingyue is here today

51
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,620
But what else do you want to say

52
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,140
This palace outfit

53
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,100
Is the concubine the empress

54
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,020
Made overnight

55
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,180
My concubine was born in an embroidery workshop

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,860
Not good at piano, chess, calligraphy and painting

57
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,820
Just this little craftsmanship

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,540
I can catch your eyes

59
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,300
Stop by today

60
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,900
Send this to you

61
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,020
Thank you for your advice yesterday

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,740
Thank you, sister, for your heart

63
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,740
What do you mean by that

64
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,860
I used to be too naive

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,140
Trying to meet the imperial concubine

66
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,100
Become a sister

67
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,540
Now it seems that I was wrong

68
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,740
I will keep my eyes open from now on

69
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,100
Remember what the imperial concubine said

70
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,420
As an assistant to the boss

71
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,620
It's my duty to help my boss

72
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,980
I'll get ready

73
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,820
Then thank you for your hard work, Special Assistant He

74
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,340
I'm going to get busy first

75
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,180
Do you really like Li Su

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,660
What are you talking about

77
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,940
I like it but I don't dare to admit it

78
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,060
Not like your character

79
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,140
You think you know me well

80
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,460
Or do you like it yourself

81
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
Want to test me

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,500
All I have in mind is work

83
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,900
For this kind of affection between children and daughters

84
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,660
No interest

85
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,540
Since there is only work in my heart

86
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,100
That's in the company

87
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,380
Ask such a question on this occasion

88
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,740
Does it seem appropriate to you

89
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,260
Sorry, Mr. Wei

90
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,460
I'm talking too much

91
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,260
It's okay

92
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,540
Fuck it well, I'm watching you

93
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,180
Mr. Wei

94
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,060
Mr. Li's female companion for so many years

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,980
It's always been you

96
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,700
How did you take this opportunity today

97
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,140
I gave it to her

98
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,220
Let

99
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,860
Let her be able to eat it too

100
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,900
In just a few hours

101
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,820
The dress thing

102
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,940
It's enough to give her a headache

103
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,380
Let's go

104
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,660
She was attending for the first time

105
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,020
Such a formal occasion

106
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,940
This so-called unwritten rule

107
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,260
Handling of interpersonal relationships

108
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,820
She's completely inexperienced

109
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm afraid there will be many mistakes and omissions by then

110
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,540
What if she

111
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,860
It's all handled perfectly

112
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,980
That's her skill, too

113
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,180
Just this one

114
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,220
Good

115
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,300
Mr. Li

116
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,740
Is there anything you want with me

117
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,780
That tonight

118
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,780
That is, with various partners

119
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,140
Connect with emotions

120
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
If there's anything you're lacking

121
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,980
You can tell me whenever you want

122
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,580
It's okay, I can do it myself

123
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,140
Are you sure

124
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,500
But I do

125
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,700
Need to prepare

126
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,620
Mr. Li

127
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,940
Can I have half a day off

128
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,900
Okay, I'll pick you up later

129
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,260
I was going to give you a dress

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
It looks pretty good now

131
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,940
That's Mr. Zhao

132
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,660
Have dealings with the company's business

133
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,260
You can say hello more later

134
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,860
I'm sorry I'm late

135
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,380
Mr. Li, I sent you a message

136
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,180
You didn't see

137
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,340
It's okay

138
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,180
Just in time to come, so let's join us

139
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,980
Mr. Zhao

140
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,180
This is what you have seen, Mr. Wei

141
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,100
This is my new assistant

142
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,100
He Jiaojiao

143
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,100
Jiaojiao

144
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,900
Mrs. Zhang

145
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,340
Mr. Li often mentions you to me

146
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,460
Say that you are Mr. Zhang's good wife

147
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,900
And keep your hobbies

148
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,300
I really envy you

149
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,540
Where Where

150
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,700
Your dress is really unique

151
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,980
Which store did you buy it

152
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,820
This

153
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,140
I designed it myself

154
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,420
If you like it

155
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,540
I'll design a set for you, too

156
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,980
Thank you so much

157
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,940
You're welcome

158
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,660
Mr. Li, you're here

159
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,180
Don't introduce your female companion

160
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,460
So beautiful

161
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,220
It's been hidden all the time

162
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,380
This is Mr. Li's assistant He Jiaokjiao

163
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,700
The first time she saw Mr. Zhao

164
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,060
Must be very happy too

165
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,180
Jiaojiao

166
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,540
Come and let's have a drink

167
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,660
Of course

168
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,540
Mr. Zhao, we

169
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,020
The company's important cooperative customers

170
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,340
Of course I need a drink

171
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,380
Mr. Zhao

172
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,500
The cooperation behind our company

173
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,220
I'll excuse you for a moment

174
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,140
How are you thinking about it

175
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,020
Let you down

176
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,740
Didn't let you see a joke

177
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,780
What are you talking about

178
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,940
Why are you still so hypocritical

179
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,060
Same as before

180
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,540
You laugh at me

181
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,860
All I laughed at was

182
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,580
21st century

183
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,380
You who are still targeting men

184
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,300
You are beautiful and have a good family background

185
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,540
And the ability

186
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,820
Why do you say you

187
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,780
Have to be for a man

188
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,940
Jealous

189
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,260
He deserves it

190
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,340
He doesn't deserve it

191
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,180
Only you are worth it

192
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,500
Is it

193
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,180
What about you

194
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,820
What are you trying to do with him

195
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,300
He's handsome, he's rich

196
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
Wei Yahan

197
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,620
Today's society

198
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,940
What is a woman

199
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,940
By one's own efforts

200
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,060
Unavailable

201
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,860
You have to rely on a man

202
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,740
Even if I like him

203
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,860
Me too. He likes me too

204
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,980
Then you're so sure

205
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,260
He must like you

206
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,740
I'm not sure

207
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,260
Compared to him

208
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,940
I know better

209
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,300
What do I want for myself

210
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,900
He Jiaojiao, please stop drinking

211
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,860
You're drunk

212
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,700
Wei Yahan, you are the one

213
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,900
Are you okay

214
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,100
Do you want me to take you home

215
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,580
No, no, no

216
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,700
Stop drinking

217
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,220
If you can't drink it, don't drink it blindly

218
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,180
Nothing, nothing

219
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,540
I told you to stop drinking, do you hear me

220
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,500
Miss Ho

221
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,020
Would you please have another drink with me

222
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,380
You can't drink this wine like this

223
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,940
Why don't we have a drink

224
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,620
Mr. Zhao

225
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,820
I didn't let one of my own

226
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,900
The habit of blocking my wine

227
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,820
Why don't I have a drink with you

228
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,620
How to

229
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,780
Where Where

230
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,980
I did

231
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,740
Mr. Li, you feel free to do anything

232
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,820
I'll be here today

233
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,060
I'm leaving first

234
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,220
Why are you standing there? Don't you leave

235
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,300
Why do you say you

236
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,220
Have to be for a man

237
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
Jealous

238
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,060
Compared to him

239
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,660
I know myself better

240
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,140
What do you want

241
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,460
Mr. Wei, why are you here

242
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,220
You're the one

243
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,860
He Jiaojiao's little follower

244
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,100
What's your name again

245
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Du

246
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,020
Du Xiaosong

247
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,380
To Du Xiaosong

248
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,540
Come

249
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,380
Du Xiaosong

250
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,580
You also like He Jiaojiao

251
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,660
He Jiaojiao asked me

252
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,100
What do you like about Li Su

253
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,980
I can't answer

254
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,180
Why do I like him

255
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,940
Because my mom told me since I was a kid

256
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,500
Don't miss the opportunity

257
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,020
Only Li Su

258
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,220
Such an excellent boy

259
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,500
To be worthy of me

260
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,220
And it's just me

261
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,380
To be qualified to stand shoulder to shoulder with him

262
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,460
Mr. Wei, let me take you home

263
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,340
Don't call me Mr. Wei

264
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,820
Call me by name

265
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,620
Ya Yahan

266
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,300
Don't you say I'm not beautiful

267
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,140
Am I not excellent

268
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,700
Don't I deserve to be liked

269
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,260
You're beautiful

270
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,140
So do you like me

271
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,340
I

272
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,580
Do you dare to kiss me

273
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
Is this not so good

274
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,700
So do you want to kiss me

275
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,580
Can you slow down

276
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
What are you doing

277
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,740
You're crazy

278
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,620
I'm mad

279
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,940
Let me ask you what are you doing

280
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,460
I

281
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,100
You're not invulnerable

282
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,940
Don't you eat hard and soft

283
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,500
At the critical moment

284
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,660
I don't know how to protect myself

285
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,060
Aren't you very good at it

286
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,820
You beat him, you scold him

287
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,740
Why don't you break his salty pig's hands

288
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,260
Do you think I want to drink with him

289
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:53,980
I'm not because

290
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,420
He's us

291
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,700
An important customer of the company

292
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,180
Yes, he's a client of our company

293
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,140
But from tomorrow

294
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,580
I will terminate

295
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,700
Work with all of them

296
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,900
You're crazy

297
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,860
I'm sensible

298
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,940
Because I know deeply

299
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,780
In this world

300
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,660
Everything Adds Up

301
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,940
Not as precious as you
