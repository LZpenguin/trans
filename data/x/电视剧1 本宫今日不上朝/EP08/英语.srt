00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,140
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,340
Done

4
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,420
Then let's go home

5
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,140
What are you posting here

6
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,540
Is this one

7
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,420
My Little Mark Little Moon

8
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,940
No matter how insignificant it is

9
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:55,660
Work hard too

10
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,580
Make your own mark

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,700
Mr. Li

12
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,180
Detailed team battle recruitment plan

13
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,180
What do you think

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,860
In such a short time

15
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,740
Able to make relatively mature solutions

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,540
Very nice

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,100
This plan is mainly composed of

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,820
The leader of the three groups in our center

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,500
Li Jiakai

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,780
Proposed and perfected

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,580
It's not as good as this plan

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,380
Just let him execute it

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,860
Li Jiakai

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,900
How long has he been in the company

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,820
Li Jia Kaijin Company

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,980
It's been five years

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,060
Five years

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,620
People who have never had any thoughts

29
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,940
Director Wu

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,140
From what year did you feel

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,340
What about his sudden thoughts

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,740
I hope you're only confused once in a while

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,940
Go busy

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,620
Mr. Wu

35
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,340
Then Lee always agrees with me

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,020
Have you implemented this plan

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,220
Mr. Wu, look

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,740
This case

39
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,580
How to adjust it

40
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
I'm going to adjust it right away

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,380
There are three types of recruitment themes in the scenario

42
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,380
Which one do you prefer

43
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,460
What about me personally

44
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,860
More inclined to the second

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,460
Of course

46
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,420
The third one is also good

47
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,700
What about the first

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,940
It also has its own advantages

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,340
But I still want Mr. Wu

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
To decide

51
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,540
In this scheme

52
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,180
There are two recruitment topics in total

53
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,140
Where did you get the third kind

54
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,100
Look at me recently

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,220
Staying up late too much

56
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,460
Yes, there are only two kinds

57
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:30,900
Good

58
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,140
Who actually made this scheme

59
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,860
Can anyone answer my question

60
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,900
Team Recruitment Ideas

61
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,860
From our company

62
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,540
In small groups

63
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,740
Working form for units

64
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,420
Is to save costs quickly

65
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,060
Put to work

66
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,740
Resulting from

67
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,420
The current cycle is five months

68
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,220
Very good

69
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,180
Now cycle

70
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,220
Needs to be compressed to three months

71
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,220
It's your responsibility

72
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,580
Temporarily held

73
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,820
Acting leader of three groups

74
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,580
As for you

75
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,740
Voluntarily leave now

76
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,060
I can

77
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,060
I'll give you three months' salary

78
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,620
As compensation

79
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,140
Others

80
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,340
Cooperate with He Jiaojiao's work

81
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,580
We'll start next week

82
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,860
Mr. Wu, you, you, me

83
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,380
He Jiaojiao

84
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,380
Mr. Wu, please don't

85
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,700
Let me explain

86
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,060
Let's go celebrate

87
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,660
It's really worth celebrating

88
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,500
What's Komatsu doing?

89
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,020
Don't you understand if you don't see any indecent assault

90
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,700
What are you talking about

91
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,620
I can't hear you clearly

92
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,580
I said they were all crazy

93
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,620
You haven't seen the world

94
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,420
He Jiaojiao

95
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,380
You just didn't drink enough

96
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:42,700
Come, come, come, come

97
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,100
Drink, drink, drink

98
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,540
You don't even call sister anymore, do you

99
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,180
Sister, what sister

100
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,060
After drinking this cup, you are brothers

101
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,340
-No, no, no, I'm not drinking 
-No, no, no, I'm not drinking

102
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,060
Drink, drink, drink

103
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,220
Small pine nuts

104
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,580
These are all gifts from the emperor

105
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,260
Yeah

106
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,140
Little master, you are going to be favored again

107
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,580
I'm bringing something nice

108
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,340
Why don't we celebrate and celebrate

109
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,940
WHAT THING

110
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,060
Wine

111
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,540
No, no, no, no

112
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,860
I can't drink

113
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,540
I'll get drunk

114
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,420
Try it. It tastes delicious

115
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,740
It's delicious to drink

116
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,980
Then I'll have a taste

117
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,620
Should be fine

118
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,220
Touch it

119
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,100
One more drink, one more drink

120
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,260
One more drink, one more drink

121
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,260
How about it? Does it taste good

122
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,620
Jiaojiao

123
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,260
I'm sorry

124
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,020
I've been targeting you all the time before

125
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,900
But you can come and be our team leader

126
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,420
I'm really happy

127
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,260
Never again

128
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,420
Being bullied by that Li Jiakai

129
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,780
That is

130
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,140
Come

131
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,020
To Jiaojiao

132
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,700
Me, Sister Li, I'm accurate in judging people

133
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,660
Look at Li Jiakai

134
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,340
Don't say

135
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,500
-Come on, come on, drink, drink, drink 
-Come on, come on, drink, drink, drink

136
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,300
Come, come, come, come

137
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,380
Dry dry dry

138
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,340
Cheers Cheers

139
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,220
That Mr. Li

140
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,020
This is all out

141
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,260
Just relax

142
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,620
That's what you're talking about

143
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
Make an appointment to meet with customers

144
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,020
Isn't it Friday today

145
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,100
Tomorrow is your birthday

146
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,700
We big guys

147
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,860
Just wanted to celebrate for you

148
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,300
Is it not

149
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,180
Celebrate

150
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,700
I'm bored, I'll go first

151
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,180
Etc. etc.

152
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,460
Wait wait wait

153
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,500
Mr. Li, Mr. Li, wait a minute

154
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,020
Would you like to sit down for a while

155
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,660
You listen to me

156
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,380
We also ordered a cake

157
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,380
Would you like to eat more or less

158
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,140
Give some face

159
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,460
Have this time

160
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,980
Why don't you delve into the business

161
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,300
Hurry up

162
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,260
The waiter

163
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,420
Prepare to serve the cake, serve the cake

164
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,020
Mr. Li, please listen to me

165
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,420
I ordered this cake for you

166
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,500
You are absolutely satisfied

167
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,740
Is a huge surprise

168
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,820
Must fit your advanced aesthetics

169
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,580
Noble and elegant

170
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,540
It looks eye-catching

171
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,140
And contains

172
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,780
Extremely full

173
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,740
And rich emotions are in it

174
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,580
Let's all give it to Mr. Li

175
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,580
Can you sing a song

176
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,100
OK OK

177
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,260
Three two one

178
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,100
♪ Say goodbye to all your worries ♪

179
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,460
♪ Say hi hi to all the happiness ♪

180
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,340
♪ Darling darling ♪

181
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,260
That on the cake on the cake

182
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,540
Who is today's birthday girl

183
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,180
He

184
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Didn't I make it clear to you

185
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,780
European courts

186
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,660
Noble, elegant and classic

187
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,380
Didn't your eyes light up

188
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,180
My eyes really lit up

189
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,540
Mr. Li

190
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,740
Let me explain that

191
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,820
That's not what happened

192
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
I arranged

193
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,740
Next month's salary cut in half

194
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,980
Mr. Li Li

195
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,220
You listen to me, you listen to me

196
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,940
By the way, I told you before

197
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,340
Jobs in African Mining Projects

198
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,940
Is there any news

199
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,620
Prepare yourself

200
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,340
Not wait, wait, wait

201
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,980
Mr. Li Mr. Li

202
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,820
Mr. Li, listen to me

203
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,940
Listen to my explanation, Mr. Li

204
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,900
I drink it myself

205
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,900
Don't you drink it either

206
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,140
No, I'll drink it myself

207
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,980
Just drink

208
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,740
Give me

209
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,300
I'll go to the bathroom first

210
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,140
No, what toilet

211
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,100
Come back soon

212
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,140
You

213
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,580
Where are you going

214
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,340
Everyone, get out of my way

215
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,020
You guys, I'm telling you

216
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,300
Dancing is not as good as me

217
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,900
Come, come, come, come

218
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,700
Drink it and the world will fall apart

219
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,100
Sky fall and earth fall

220
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,660
Drink

221
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,140
Emperor

222
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,300
Why doesn't Komatsu drink it

223
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Hurry up, drink and clink glasses

224
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,100
The emperor is coming up

225
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,180
The emperor is coming up

226
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,260
I'd like to see the emperor

227
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,540
Small pine nuts

228
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,620
Emperor

229
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,340
What's going on

230
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,500
Pretty handsome

231
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,020
Your Majesty

232
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,060
Who made her drink so much

233
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,460
Let go of her. She's my guy

234
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
Brother, you're wrong

235
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,060
There is always a first-come-first-served approach in everything

236
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,380
I told you she was mine

237
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,140
You get out of my way

238
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,140
Did you see

239
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,380
It was posted by the little beauty herself

240
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,260
Are you trying to flirt with me

241
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,980
I'll go

242
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,020
Little sister is quite active

243
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,620
My feet

244
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,540
What do you want to do to me

245
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,740
Dare to mess with my sister Jiaojiao

246
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,900
I will destroy you on behalf of the moon

247
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,220
Let's take you home

248
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,380
No, no, no, no

249
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,940
No, no, no, I have to dance

250
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,260
Get her stuff

251
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,820
I want to dance

252
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,740
I want to sing

253
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,180
Fortunately, Komatsu protected me

254
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,140
I'll never drink again

255
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,580
Can't drink and still drink so much

256
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,820
Stupid to death

257
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,340
Let me go

258
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,580
I want to drink

259
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,220
Don't move

260
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,900
Let me go

261
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,300
Let go, I want a drink

262
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,780
He Jiaojiao

263
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,220
I'm going to drink it for another three days and three nights

264
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,780
Don't move

265
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
What's so noisy? It's so noisy

266
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,620
This feel

267
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,780
So this is how it is

268
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,380
He looks pretty handsome

269
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,780
You look like someone

270
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,100
It's just as unstoppable

271
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,100
You said you obviously had everything

272
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,380
Why do you want to

273
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,900
How many times have you approached me

274
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,380
Isn't it

275
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,540
Did you approach me first

276
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,700
Obviously you will leave me

277
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,740
Why do you have to

278
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,420
How many times have you given me a chance

279
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,380
I don't have me

280
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,340
Your heart

281
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,300
Is it beating for me alone

282
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,140
He Jiaojiao, don't move around

283
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,460
You don't want me anymore

284
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,780
You're in front of everyone

285
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,980
Don't want me anymore

286
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,660
You don't want me anymore

287
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,540
Look at me

288
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,380
I didn't have

289
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,620
You this

290
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,140
Cold and cold big pig's trotters

291
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,420
Hello

292
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,180
[Sister Jiaojiao, where are you]

293
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,020
I'm at home

294
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
[That's good, that's good]

295
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,300
Not you

296
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,980
[I'm sleeping myself]

297
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,020
[By the way]

298
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,060
[It seems today]

299
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,380
[It's still Mr. Li's birthday]

300
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,340
Li Su

301
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,060
[Sister Jiaojiao]

302
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,100
[Look at the circle of friends]

303
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,220
[And our work group]

304
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,220
[They need to]

305
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,380
[Is it so exaggerated?]

306
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,460
In the palace

307
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,260
Build a good relationship with your superiors

308
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,900
Is very important

309
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:02,820
Unexpectedly

310
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,940
It's so exaggerated now

311
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,020
There are actually people stuck at zero points
