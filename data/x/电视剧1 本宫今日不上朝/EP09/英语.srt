[Episode 9]

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,740
Dear concubines

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,060
Please take your seats

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,620
Yuer

6
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,500
Emperor

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,420
The concubine embroidered a brocade with her own hands

8
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,140
Want to dedicate to the emperor

9
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,860
Emperor

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,780
This is the brocade sent by Concubine Zhao

11
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,820
Nice

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,300
Emperor

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,180
Every stitch and thread on this

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,220
It was all sewn by my concubine herself

15
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,700
Concubine

16
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,260
In that remote cold palace

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,740
All right

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,940
Go back and sit down

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,220
There is still a lot of resentment between words

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,540
It's really stupid

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,580
Emperor

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,940
Concubine is not like Zhao Concubine's sister

23
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,620
So ingenious

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,780
Just prepared a dance

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,300
I also hope the emperor

26
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,460
Don't dislike your concubines

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,660
Let me see

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,420
The string breaks

29
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,060
Always bodes on the wall

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,340
Concubine Jing not only made a fool of herself this time

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,260
I'm afraid it will be

32
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,700
Make the emperor disgusted

33
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,900
Your Majesty

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,340
Okay, go back and rest

35
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,460
I wish the emperor a long life

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,620
It was also specially prepared for the emperor

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,100
A little thought from my concubine

38
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,740
Compared to

39
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,700
Just now, Concubine Zhao herself

40
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,740
Embroidered silk and satin

41
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,660
It's a joke

42
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,620
Wei Guifei is not only

43
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,380
I'm here to offer treasure to the emperor

44
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,540
Also here to demonstrate to us

45
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,500
I wonder if the emperor likes it

46
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,540
Not bad, I like it very much

47
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,420
In the heart of my concubine

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,860
Your Majesty is the sky full of stars

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,780
Will be eclipsed

50
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,860
The only sun

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,220
This is also the meaning of this dragon robe

52
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,660
Wei Guifei has a heart

53
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,380
I think this dragon robe

54
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,740
There is still a phoenix robe to match

The meat is not disgusting

68

It's too disgusting, isn't it

69
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,180
If you are well, it will be sunny

70
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,300
May you pass through thousands of sails

71

Am I not a teenager now

73

Common in famine years

All the floods this year have been flooded

103

Parents are separated without love

104

The fragrance of ten miles of rice flowers

107

There is no hunger and discouragement in prosperous times

108

Why do you need to be busy with farming and weaving

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,020
Triumphant

174
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,820
In the end

175
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,900
Show concern for his body

176
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,660
Not only embodies

177
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,180
We have a close relationship

178
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,260
He also secretly expressed his loyalty

179
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,860
Perfect precision strike

180
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,980
Have you learned it

181
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,540
You woke up

182
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,340
[You're awake]

183
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,020
What do you mean

184
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,420
Hello Du Xiaosong

185
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,260
Who the hell sent me back yesterday

186
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,380
[It seems to say]

187
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,540
[It was Mr. Li who carried you home]

188
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,420
What

189
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Impossible

190
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,820
Impossible impossible

191
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,260
There's no way I can do such a thing

192
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,140
Especially for Li Su

193
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,020
How could I possibly

194
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,300
He Mingyue

195
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,460
If you dare to drink again, I will

196
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,260
He Jiaojiao, right

197
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,060
Accelerated negotiations

198
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,260
Within three months

199
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,380
I want everything

200
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,260
All on the right track

201
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,580
Sister Jiaojiao, please listen to my explanation

202
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,140
You weren't yesterday

203
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,660
Nothing happened

204
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,900
If anything really happened

205
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,460
Do you think you can still

206
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,020
Stand here alive and talk to me

207
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,380
Release

208
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,500
You loosen, too

209
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,220
What happened to you yesterday

210
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,420
I drank too much yesterday

211
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,380
I'm sorry, Mr. Li

212
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,460
I swear

213
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,460
I'm never drinking again

214
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,420
You really shouldn't drink anymore

215
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,300
So what happened yesterday

216
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,940
Please also consider it

217
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,140
Nothing ever happened

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,020
Nothing happened

219
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,300
Do you know what you did yesterday

220
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,540
Whatever I did yesterday

221
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,780
Please don't take it seriously

222
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,860
Just having fun

223
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,580
Just having fun

224
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,620
You play the same way with others

225
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,380
It really opened my eyes

226
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,300
I didn't expect you to play so freely

227
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,140
No matter who I play with

228
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,900
Don't bother you, Mr. Li

229
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,300
You

230
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,900
He Jiaojiao

231
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,300
I'm sorry, Mr. Li

232
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,100
All I'm focused on is work right now

233
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm going back to work

234
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,980
You

235
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,460
Don't you work

236
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,900
Waiting to go to Africa

237
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,460
Sister Jiaojiao, you didn't last night

238
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,340
What are you thinking about

239
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,180
I'm not thinking about anything

240
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,540
What are you thinking

241
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,940
Duty cycle

242
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,100
Compressed to three months

243
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Get back to work

244
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,500
Mr. Li doesn't seem to be anything

245
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,580
Someone who takes advantage of the situation

246
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,380
Why just looked like

247
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,900
It's like he's been taken advantage of

248
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,980
Morning Mr. Li

249
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,140
Your milk

250
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,180
President

251
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,260
Where are you going

252
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,540
He Jiaojiao

253
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,220
You, you, what are you doing

254
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,260
President, I'm fine

255
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,820
I want to drink water

256
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,820
He Jiaojiao, let me tell you

257
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,900
You're playing with fire

258
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,340
Come quickly

259
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,780
Drink water

260
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,500
Thank you

261
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,500
Thank you. Hurry up.

262
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,140
Give

263
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,620
No, no, no, no

264
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,900
I want you to feed me

265
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,540
I want you to feed me with your mouth

266
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,260
There are assassins

267
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,220
I knew it

268
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,380
You're a horny big pig's trotter

269
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,420
Today I'm gonna do justice for heaven

270
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,140
He Jiaojiao

271
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,100
Listen to her say that

272
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:01,740
She is

273
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,300
Is deliberately playing with my feelings

274
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,780
Mr. Li, what did you say

275
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,100
Don't ask if you shouldn't

276
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,180
Take it down

277
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,140
Mr. Li, this is a glass of milk before going to bed

278
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,900
A glass of milk in the morning

279
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,700
Isn't it your habit

280
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,420
I said you

281
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,620
Why are you talking so much now

282
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,020
Take it when I ask you to take it

283
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,300
Take it away

284
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,500
Don't waste it

285
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,940
No drinking

286
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,660
Down

287
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,740
Additionally

288
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,980
Five minutes later

289
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,340
Hold executive meetings

290
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,820
Recent work efficiency

291
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,620
Why is it so slow

292
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,660
Okay, Mr. Li

293
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,580
I'll inform you right away

294
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,900
Komatsu

295
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,100
Help Sister Li finish it

296
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,460
Finishing touches

297
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,740
Our recruitment activity this time

298
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,780
Even if it's over

299
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,980
I didn't think we could actually finish it

300
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,260
Sister Jiaojiao

301
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm not flattering

302
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
You take care of the work

303
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,020
Not like a newbie at all

304
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,340
After all, it has been hosted several times

305
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,540
Show girl selection person

306
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,300
Can it be the same

307
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,980
My Mr. Wei, you're back

308
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,340
Mr. Wei, we all miss you so much

309
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,340
Why do you look so like Concubine Wei

310
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,900
You showed up after all

311
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,100
I've been waiting for you for a long time
