I'm fine

How

You want me to press the elevator again

7
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,860
No need

8
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,260
I want to press

9
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,860
Wait a minute

What are you doing here

Don't you go in

And newspapers

18
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,540
I brought you all at once

Why are you doing it to me again

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,860
This attitude

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,860
Last night

What exactly do you want

Mr. Li

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,660
I can't drink

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,020
I get drunk when I drink

38
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,540
When you get drunk, you can't remember anything

39

What's wrong

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,220
If you have nothing to do, you want to act coquettish with me

My ears will get hot

My breathing will get short

67
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,940
My heart will speed up, too

68
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,740

71

Why did you just say it like that

72
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,300
Not

You liked her in your previous life

It's pretty good

Come on, work hard

You can do it

That

80
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,780
Then do you think I

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,860
Is it whimsical

82
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,100
Like someone

Wei Yahan, I like you

I want to be responsible for you

How do you know

92
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,980
That was my first kiss

93
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,580

It's not ugly, is it

101
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,740
No car, no house

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,220
There is no bright future

103
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,300
But

104
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,420
But I have this

You're also responsible

113
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,740
Answer the phone

You don't have to worry about me

Don't worry

[Stop acting]

120
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,860
I'm not asking you to come back as an assistant

121
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,900
Then I'm relieved

122
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,420
[Don't have time to talk to you]

123
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,860
Let me ask you

124
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,020
I have a friend

[etc. etc.]

126
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,500
You you have no friends

127
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,980
Your friend is yourself

128
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,660
You close

129
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,020

I have A friend A

132

He was kissed by B

133
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,420
But what about this B

134
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,780
She didn't admit to kissing A

135
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,860
And the attitude towards A

136
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,980
And very cold

137
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,980
You say my friend

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,820
What should I do

139
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,180
Mr. Li

140
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,700
I didn't expect you to be such a scumbag

141
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,460
I told you it wasn't me

142

Do you want to fly straight to Africa

144

[No, no, no, it's not Mr. Li]

145
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,540
Then that's you being scum

146

Which female hero is it

I'm out and I'm still talking to you

177
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,780
Li Su

178
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,980
What is Assistant He doing here

179
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,380
I have something to do with you

180
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,860
What is it

181
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,140
What happened last night

182
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
I remember

183
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,260
Remembered

184
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,580
Isn't it just a kiss

185
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,660
Isn't it just a kiss

186
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,220
Then Assistant He is really

187
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,260
A man of unrestrained character

188
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,700
He Jiaojiao

189
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,820
Do you like me

190
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,180
I really like you

191
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,460
Sorry to interrupt

192
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,340
It's so disgusting

193
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,260
I couldn't hold back

194
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,380
When did you come

195
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,020
I came at the beginning

196
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,700
But you

197
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Compare investment

198
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
So what do you have to do

199
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,980
I'm here to quit my job

200
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,780
What

201
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,420
Congratulations

202
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,860
Finally decided to find myself

203
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,820
Because I lost

204
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,180
Continue to stay in this company

205
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Reasons and goals

206
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,180
What do you mean

207
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,500
Li Su, you will always be high above you

208
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,020
Get used to others circling you

209
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,180
You won't understand

210
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,980
Just never understand

211
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,780
Mr. Li, please speak your mouth first

212
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,260
I'm going to talk to Mr. Wei alone

213
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,980
Bye-bye go

214
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,780
Go!

215
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,420
Let's give his company first

216
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm sorry, Mr. Li

217
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,860
The resignation application just now

218
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,780
I was impulsive

219
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,820
I have to think about it in the future

220
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,180
Continue to work for this company

221
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,460
So

222
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,700
You two

223
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
What the hell did you just say

224
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,460
-this is our girl's secret 
-this is our girl's secret

225
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,940
This company also counts

226
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,020
Have you worked hard

227
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,020
I heard you started college

228
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,260
I followed Li Su to start a business

229
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,420
Before I mistakenly thought

230
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,540
I like him myself

231
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,660
But now I understand

232
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,500
That was just forced on me

233
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,700
It's just a habit

234
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,220
Without this reason

235
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
I really can't find anything

236
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,100
Continue to strive for the goal

237
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,100
Have you ever thought about it

238
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,580
Let's take over the company

239
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,580
We

240
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,460
To us

241
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,740
Are you gonna

242
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,660
What's wrong with it

243
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,020
All along

244
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,140
I really appreciate it

245
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,300
Your talents and abilities

246
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,780
Soon I'll show you, too

247
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,420
My sincerity and strength

248
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,180
So don't you think it's interesting

249
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,140
This is indeed

250
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,940
Something worth challenging

251
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,740
You decided to help me

252
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,580
Can

253
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,460
But I have another problem

254
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,140
Since we decided to cooperate

255
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,540
Then between the two of us

256
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,420
Be honest

257
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,980
Your feelings for Li Su

258
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,140
Is it true

259
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,220
What do you think

260
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,660
Okay, then I'll go first

261
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,500
Mr. Li, I'm leaving first too

262
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,380
I like you

263
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,180
I like you too

264
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,260
If time

265
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,580
Can really stay

266
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,780
It would be fine at that moment

267
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,820
Maybe I'm really doing something wrong

268
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,980
But you succeeded

269
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,220
Although you leave

270
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,140
But it took his heart away

271
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,180
Bright moon

272
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,340
Wake up quickly

273
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,100
I was wrong

274
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,700
I really know I'm wrong

275
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,700
From beginning to end

276
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,820
You are the only one I love

277
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,020
The emperor invites me to dinner

278
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,580
Take it down, I can't eat it

279
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,860
Your Majesty, please eat some

280
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,100
I'm afraid of you if I don't eat my slave

281
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Hurt the dragon's body

282
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,300
Taiyuan Hospital researched it

283
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,540
Did you find out how to treat the queen

284
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,660
Reply to the emperor

285
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,620
The imperial doctors in the Imperial Hospital said

286
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,540
Said it would take a while

287
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,540
A bunch of waste

288
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,340
Pass the order down

289
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,380
If there is no way within three days

290
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,740
Chop them all off

291
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,620
Your Majesty, calm down, Your Majesty, calm down

292
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,620
Lord President, let's go home

293
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,540
Let's go home

294
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,060
You want to eat flies

295
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,580
I don't want to eat flies

296
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,380
What do you want to eat

297
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,540
You can eat anything

298
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,260
Who are you

299
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,340
Emperor
