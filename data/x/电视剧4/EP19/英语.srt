00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:40,167
Fall in Love with a Fox EP19

3
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,180
Jin Baiwan from Jin's Escort Agency

4
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,539
pay respects to Host Jing Yuan.

5
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,060
The first time I saw you,

6
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:18,259
you were just eight.

7
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:20,339
You did not have

8
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,299
the feeling of horror like today.

9
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,979
Do you really know me?

10
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:26,700
You joined my Nonuple Palace at eight

11
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,060
for the whole ten years.

12
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:29,420
Now,

13
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,659
don't you forget everything?

14
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,780
I come to the Battle of martial arts by the lake

15
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,140
just for the Lingyao Herb,

16
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,539
so as to restore my memory.

17
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:38,859
Then I could know

18
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,420
who I am.

19
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,660
What could you do

20
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,460
if you restore your memory?

21
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,499
I will do what I should do.

22
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:50,139
When you

23
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:51,619
joined Nonuple Palace,

24
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,539
I had asked you

25
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,180
why you

26
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,460
wanted to join us.

27
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:56,740
You told me that

28
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,539
you don't want to be bullied by bad guys.

29
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,940
You want to enforce justice on behalf of Heaven,

30
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,940
and do what you want to do.

31
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,300
It seems that

32
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,539
whatever you

33
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,619
have suffered,

34
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,539
you didn't change.

35
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,220
Host Jing Yuan, I wonder

36
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:10,979
what you

37
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,220
want from me.

38
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:16,139
Do you know

39
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,180
why I fish here?

40
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,220
For me,

41
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,300
there's no need to

42
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,339
make effort to lure the poor fish.

43
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,539
All I need is to wait for the right time,

44
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,619
and they will be hooked voluntarily.

45
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,259
Host Jing Yuan, if you do things like this,

46
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,539
I am afraid that instead of getting what you want,

47
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,300
it will be counterproductive.

48
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,740
Host

49
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,899
I did an unfavorable work,

50
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,139
and couldn't stop Qu Zheng.

51
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:46,379
Leave.

52
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:46,860
Yes, sir.

53
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:49,659
You took my wife away

54
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:50,779
without my consent.

55
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,939
It's not what a gentleman should do.

56
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,499
If there's nothing to do,

57
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,260
we will leave.

58
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,180
Don't worry, Lord Qu.

59
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,540
I asked Miss Jin here today

60
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,819
just for reminiscing about the past.

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,099
Host Jing Yuan, I'm afraid

62
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,980
you will be disappointed.

63
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,460
You didn't find

64
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
the right person.

65
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:24,540
Oh, really?

66
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,980
True or false, it depends...

67
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,300
I might get things

68
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,300
wrong sometimes.

69
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:32,499
But fortunately,

70
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:33,420
everything will be

71
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,619
in public soon.

72
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,779
What?

73
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:45,059
Qu Zheng is here?

74
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,140
He sucks.

75
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,420
How dare he come here?

76
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:48,619
He also threatened you

77
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:49,980
for not getting the Lingyao Herb.

78
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,339
Yeah. He's living right opposite.

79
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:53,379
Certainly,

80
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,379
men are all irresponsible.

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,580
I've been told

82
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,300
the same words by Yu Linfeng.

83
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,180
Do they really think

84
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,379
that without them,

85
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,540
we can't do anything?

86
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,300
This time,

87
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,580
we won't allow their tricks

88
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,659
do work.

89
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,700
Yeah.

90
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:10,740
Absolutely.

91
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,740
Do you know how dangerous

92
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,580
the Battle of martial arts by the lake is?

93
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:14,740
Not to mention anything else,

94
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,540
just the first round of the knockout,

95
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,180
it's still a question

96
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,260
whether you two will be eliminated.

97
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,339
Knockout?

98
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,499
What is knockout?

99
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,700
You wicked girl.

100
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,219
Meet me here,

101
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:51,260
and you will know

102
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,899
how I will deal with you later.

103
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,980
Muqiu

104
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,740
I really shouldn't let you

105
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,740
accompany me in the competition.

106
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,139
How could I

107
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,420
explain to Head Escort Jin

108
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,939
if you get injured.

109
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:01,900
Look where we are now,

110
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,819
and you are saying this kind of stuff.

111
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,780
Many hands make light.

112
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,980
Muqiu is right.

113
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,980
Contestants, attention please.

114
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,459
This is the first prize

115
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:23,340
of the Battle of martial arts by the lake,

116
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:24,379
Lingyao Herb.

117
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,540
The first round of the knockout

118
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,379
will start soon.

119
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:28,900
In this knockout,

120
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,939
all the contestants will be divided into

121
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,900
two camps, red and blue.

122
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,459
Both of the two camps have to

123
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,259
find out the 70 tokens hiding in the forest.

124
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:35,860
After six hours,

125
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,379
the camp with more tokens will win.

126
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,780
And the other one will be eliminated.

127
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,780
Oh, no.

128
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,619
A large half of contestants will be out in the first round.

129
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:44,980
During the competition,

130
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,860
the number of tokens in both camps

131
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:47,860
will be reported three times.

132
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,540
At the second report,

133
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,819
the members of two camps can choose

134
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,939
whether to change their camp.

135
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,819
The introduction of the first round is done.

136
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,699
Members in the winner camp

137
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,100
will enter the second round.

138
00:06:58,499 --> 00:06:59,740
One-on-one wheel battle.

139
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,660
The final winner

140
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,300
will get Lingyao Herb.

141
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,100
Now all the contestants

142
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,420
come to the stage and choose your camp.

143
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:07,740
Go...

144
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:10,699
Baiwan

145
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,699
Which color do you want to choose?

146
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:14,660
Red?

147
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,619
Okay.

148
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,740
It seems that you

149
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,340
have made your choice.

150
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,139
He will choose red like you.

151
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,420
Then I will choose

152
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,180
blue.

153
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,540
How could he choose blue!

154
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,980
The game has not started yet,

155
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,780
Baiwan, will you

156
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:36,939
consider changing you camp?

157
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,780
I don't want to be in the same camp with you.

158
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,780
So there must be one

159
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,259
to be eliminated between you and me.

160
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,059
And the person,

161
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,740
is definitely not me.

162
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:58,259
Sir

163
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,059
Qu Zheng chose the blue camp.

164
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,420
After all,

165
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,459
he's the final winner of the last competition.

166
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,579
Let's choose blue.

167
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:03,819
Okay.

168
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,860
Wait...

169
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,499
What do you want, your Majesty?

170
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
You're the representative of

171
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,860
the Nonuple Palace this time,

172
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,660
so you must win.

173
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,540
Especially in the first round.

174
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
I know it.

175
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,220
Then,

176
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:33,420
choose blue.

177
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:37,059
Yes.

178
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:56,540
This is the signal rocket.

179
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,660
And this is my secret smoke.

180
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,900
Generally speaking,

181
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,900
it is unlikely that

182
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,139
life-and-death struggles and injuries will occur

183
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,340
in the early stages of the competition.

184
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,259
What about the next stages?

185
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,300
If there is danger

186
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,579
in the next stages,

187
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,939
fire this signal rocket.

188
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,180
And the disciples from Nonuple Palace

189
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,300
and Yan School

190
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,819
will come to heal.

191
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,740
So if I fire this signal rocket,

192
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,059
I will be eliminated, right?

193
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,459
Then I don't want it.

194
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:18,740
Take it!

195
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Do you expect

196
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,579
you can win

197
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:21,540
by your lousy kung fu?

198
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,420
Nonuple Palace chose blue

199
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,300
this time.

200
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:27,900
It seems that

201
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,780
the blue camp

202
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,220
will win this year.

203
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:31,540
It's not certain.

204
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:33,059
You know the rules

205
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,860
of the Battle of martial arts by the lake.

206
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,860
Maybe,

207
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,540
some of them will be rats.

208
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,220
Rats?

209
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,740
That's right.

210
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:38,939
If there are some rats,

211
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:39,900
it's probably

212
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,699
your chance to win.

213
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,939
I won't lose.

214
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,900
The Battle of martial arts by the lake officially starts now.

215
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,540
All the people go to the forest, please.

216
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:57,259
Come on, girls!

217
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,219
It scared me!

218
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,099
That's okay.

219
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:30,699
It's just a bird. Go!

220
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:33,859
Who's there?

221
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:34,540
It's okay, Muqiu.

222
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:35,699
Two ladies

223
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:41,819
How did you follow us?

224
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,739
The Battle is so dangerous,

225
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,059
how can I let you

226
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,300
participate it alone,

227
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
while I am sitting there?

228
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,059
Leave me alone.

229
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,699
Sister Qiu'er

230
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:58,780
Sister Qiu'er

231
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,059
-Muqiu -Sister Qiu'er

232
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,780
If I knew it earlier,

233
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,780
I wouldn't bring you with us.

234
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,819
Didn't you just help us

235
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:04,979
drive away two thieves

236
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,099
and arrange a table to eat?

237
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,219
Arrange something to eat?

238
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,780
Wasn't that you?

239
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,180
Then... Was that Baiwan?

240
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,500
Then who could it be?

241
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,380
Baiwan

242
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,059
Is that a token?

243
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,620
Awesome!

244
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:21,819
This is really a token.

245
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:22,780
Hey girl!

246
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:24,540
If you want to

247
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,579
leave this forest alive,

248
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:27,260
just give me the token

249
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,059
in your hand.

250
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,180
Yu Chen, you again!

251
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,260
He is the ugly and stupid young master

252
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,140
of the Yu family

253
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,380
you mentioned?

254
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,579
How dare you

255
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:37,819
ruin my reputation like this?

256
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,780
OK!

257
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:40,979
Then let's settle

258
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,900
the past together today!

259
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:43,900
You two go quickly,

260
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,859
I am more than enough

261
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:45,380
to deal with them.

262
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:45,660
Hurry up!

263
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,939
Move!

264
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:54,780
Baiwan

265
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:55,380
You go first.

266
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,219
How about you?

267
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:56,699
I can't leave him

268
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:57,219
alone here.

269
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:58,059
Hurry!

270
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,699
Muqiu

271
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:03,540
Grandmasters

272
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,380
All the contestants

273
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,260
are in the forest.

274
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:08,699
Please go back to Lake Manor

275
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:09,900
and wait for the result.

276
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:11,699
This competition is

277
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,859
rather fierce,

278
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,699
it will produce

279
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:16,180
more martial heroes.

280
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,219
Go!

281
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,339
Let's wait in the Lake Manor.

282
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,660
Host

283
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:26,859
Please!

284
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:27,579
Please!

285
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:28,540
Please!

286
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:35,380
Your Majesty

287
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:37,099
It seems that

288
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,219
Qu Zheng and Jin Baiwan are not in one mind.

289
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,300
No matter what

290
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,660
he is up to,

291
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,059
he just needs to

292
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:45,540
show up here.

293
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:46,339
Then...

294
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,380
What about Jin Baiwan?

295
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,859
Qu Zheng is here for her,

296
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:54,739
we must ensure her safety.

297
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:57,699
Yes!

298
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,579
The token is counted as a score

299
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:06,579
by handing it over to the stronghold.

300
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,420
But where is the stronghold?

301
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,459
It's you.

302
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,660
I said you should believe me.

303
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,540
What do you want to do?

304
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:24,859
Aren't these what you want?

305
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:26,979
You're in the blue camp.

306
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,219
Would you want to give me

307
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,939
all these tokens?

308
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:31,540
Going further east,

309
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,620
and it is the stronghold of the knockout.

310
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,180
Take these tokens to the stronghold,

311
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,620
and your camp can win easily.

312
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,219
But in this way, you will be eliminated.

313
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,620
Don't worry,

314
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:41,140
I will help you get the Lingyao Herb.

315
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,500
I won't be eliminated.

316
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,660
If you do like this,

317
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,579
don't say you won't be eliminated,

318
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,420
the whole camp will lose.

319
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,459
Those are mine.

320
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,339
What are you doing?

321
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:57,939
Put them down!

322
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,140
But I see with my own eyes

323
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,660
those are from the member of our blue camp.

324
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,140
How could they become yours?

325
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,780
I gave her those tokens.

326
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:07,420
Put them down.

327
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:09,939
If so,

328
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:11,699
I can't put them down.

329
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:44,819
Give me the tokens.

330
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:05,819
I don't know whether you

331
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,780
care about me

332
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,979
or Qi.

333
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:18,540
Wait for me.

334
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,819
Give them to me!

335
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:40,540
I give you these,

336
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:41,660
so you can give it to her,

337
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,339
and make sure she will not be eliminated?

338
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,620
How I act has nothing to do with you.

339
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:50,260
Do you really think

340
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,699
it is good for her to let her stay

341
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,339
in the Battle?

342
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:55,620
You are just afraid that

343
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,540
when she gets the Lingyao Herb,

344
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
she will remember everything before.

345
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,819
I used to be like this,

346
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,939
but now,

347
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,819
no matter what she wants to do,

348
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,579
I will be with her.

349
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,180
I'm not interested in how you think.

350
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:09,339
Stop!

351
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
You are in the same camp,

352
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:15,859
why do you fight each other?

353
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,660
I don't even know that

354
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,500
the Battle has the rule

355
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:28,459
that the member in the same camp

356
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,380
could not fight?

357
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:30,819
Then you can treat me

358
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,059
as nosy, Mr Qu.

359
00:16:58,459 --> 00:16:59,459
Just some rabbles.

360
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,140
I can handle with them.

361
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,859
Take care of yourself.

362
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,339
Dare to hit me!

363
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,380
I don't care if he's

364
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,300
the Young Master of Taoyuan Valley,

365
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,780
you must find him!

366
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,260
Yes!

367
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,620
Go ahead!

368
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:33,660
They finally left.

369
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,500
What you did just now

370
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:00,739
can prove that

371
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,380
you have me in your heart.

372
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,579
I was forced

373
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:10,459
by circumstances.

374
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,699
If that is by circumstances,

375
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,459
you look into my eyes,

376
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:16,140
and tell me that you never

377
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,859
have me in your heart.

378
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:22,579
I...

379
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:27,540
You see,

380
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:30,300
you even can't admit this lie.

381
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,900
I know that you are still angry about

382
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,500
burning the novels.

383
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:40,459
But it has been passed

384
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:41,660
so long,

385
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,140
why wouldn't you get it over?

386
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,660
I don't get it over?

387
00:18:51,939 --> 00:18:52,660
Qiu'er

388
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,060
I know,

389
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,380
we have so many rules in Taoyuan Valley.

390
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,539
But how could we

391
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,660
stay with each other

392
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,259
if you don't obey the rules?

393
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:02,779
Could it be that

394
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,060
the price of my marriage with you

395
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,620
is to destroy my novels?

396
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,459
I absolutely know

397
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,539
that you love novels,

398
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:10,979
but it's really hard to accept novels

399
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,580
in our Taoyuan Valley.

400
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:13,739
Are you going to break up with me

401
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,939
for the sake of novels?

402
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:21,739
So in your heart,

403
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,299
my novels

404
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,219
are always a plaything that

405
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,860
Taoyuan Valley can destroy at any time,

406
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:29,420
right?

407
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,299
You... Why are you crying?

408
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,660
Is... Is that I said something wrong?

409
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,459
My novels

410
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,660
are never

411
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,979
just playthings.

412
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:51,739
Mr Yu, if you still

413
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,580
think like that,

414
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,259
I think we should break up.

415
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:03,699
Sister Qiu'er

416
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:11,340
Sister Qiu'er

417
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,979
Bear the pain.

418
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:16,380
Dry Su

419
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:19,219
Please treat the injured, doctor.

420
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,699
Why is the injured from the red camp again?

421
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:22,939
The blue camp is so powerful this year.

422
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,100
Take a rest there.

423
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,420
Okay.

424
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,939
It will be fine soon.

425
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:30,140
Zheng in the blue camp,

426
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,939
'cause they're in an overwhelming victory.

427
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:33,539
Why are you here?

428
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:34,939
You didn't take part in the competition?

429
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,539
It's just

430
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,580
a sh*t Battle.

431
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:39,259
Zheng could win

432
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:40,299
with his eyes closed

433
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,860
with or without me.

434
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,699
If Zheng wins,

435
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,060
what does Baiwan do?

436
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,380
Don't worry.

437
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:48,699
With Zheng there,

438
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,739
Baiwan doesn't have to worry about it.

439
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:56,699
By the way,

440
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,739
Qu Zheng is

441
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,900
really powerful.

442
00:20:59,219 --> 00:20:59,979
Only after a while,

443
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:00,739
he grabbed 15 tokens

444
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:01,939
for the blue camp.

445
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,340
If we knew it earlier, we would go to the blue camp too.

446
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:04,979
That's it.

447
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,140
What could I do?

448
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:08,820
It's all Qu Zheng's fault.

449
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:10,699
You think about me

450
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,499
all the time,

451
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,180
and it makes me happy.

452
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:16,660
Why do you come here?

453
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,539
Could it be that you

454
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,539
have been following me secretly?

455
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
It is because of following you

456
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:21,979
that I will have more gains.

457
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,739
We have so many tokens,

458
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,140
we will surely pass the knockout this time.

459
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:25,660
That's it!

460
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:26,979
You two!

461
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:29,779
I remember

462
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,299
you're the disciples from Feng Mount.

463
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:33,900
Er...

464
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,660
Yes.

465
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:36,699
Hello, Lord Qu.

466
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:37,459
One year earlier,

467
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:39,259
I have saved the Grandmaster of Feng Mount,

468
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:40,820
and the Grandmaster has promised me that

469
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,180
he would pay me back.

470
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,979
I wonder if this is true?

471
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:44,779
Er...

472
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,259
But this is the competition.

473
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,140
If we surrender the tokens

474
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,100
submissively,

475
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:51,100
I'm afraid...

476
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:51,860
That's it.

477
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,699
You're right.

478
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,180
I have no intention of breaking the rules of

479
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,060
the Battle.

480
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,100
Then we will follow the rules

481
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,140
and compete squarely.

482
00:21:58,539 --> 00:21:59,420
Please make a move.

483
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:00,979
Hit him!

484
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:02,979
That's right.

485
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,380
You're right, Lord Qu.

486
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,380
We Feng Mount

487
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:06,539
must pay you back.

488
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,699
Yes!

489
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,860
Here you are.

490
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,219
Is this Okay?

491
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,219
Isn't it a foul?

492
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,539
We guard of the strongholds

493
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,499
just count the scores of each stronghold.

494
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:17,900
The tokens are for those who are highly skilled.

495
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,620
Oh, my god.

496
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,140
Highly skilled?

497
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,140
I think the rules of

498
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,459
the Battle

499
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,539
are so fair.

500
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:27,299
Fair?

501
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,739
Fair what?

502
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,739
What do you want to do

503
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:44,539
by following me?

504
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,779
There is the Battle of martial arts by the lake,

505
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:47,900
I'm here

506
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,660
for the competition.

507
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:49,340
You...

508
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:57,380
This token is mine,

509
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,140
don't you want to take it away.

510
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,380
Baiwan, you worry too much.

511
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,939
The scores of our blue camp is

512
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,979
far in distance.

513
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,580
This mere token

514
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,140
has no effect at all.

515
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,219
Envoy Xueyue

516
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,299
What do you call me?

517
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:13,580
I... I want to ask you

518
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:14,820
what is the score now?

519
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,499
Plus the four tokens Mr Qu has,

520
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,380
15 for red camp, and 21 for the blue.

521
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,259
The blue camp keeps ahead.

522
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:23,180
Why is the gap so big?

523
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,539
What can I do?

524
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,259
Do you want to know what you can do?

525
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,580
What the hell are you up to?

526
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:34,180
I'll tell you

527
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,140
as long as you quit the competition now.

528
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:36,259
Not gonna happen.

529
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:44,420
What is it?

530
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,739
The report about the first half.

531
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,219
The first bell rang.

532
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:52,140
It seems that we have made right choice

533
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,539
in choosing blue camp.

534
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,939
The first bell rang.

535
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:56,739
Notify others to start the second half

536
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,259
of switching the camp.

537
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:00,100
Yes.

10538
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:00,699
Switch?

539
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,100
Switching camp?

540
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:05,660
You even attacked the blue members,

541
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,539
seemed that you are ready

542
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:08,539
to be the rat.

543
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,380
We red camp

544
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:11,580
is clearly behind so much,

545
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:12,539
why you...

546
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,539
You...

547
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,539
You are not qualified to ask me questions.

548
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,219
You...

549
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,060
Stop!

550
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:22,979
Stop there!

551
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,060
You... Go away!

552
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:25,779
Don't get close to me!

553
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:34,979
I'm Fang Ding.

554
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,820
I'm switching from the red camp to the blue camp.

555
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,539
Follow me to the stronghold to do the record.

556
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,380
Okay.

557
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,660
What does it mean?

558
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:47,820
Don't you know it, Baiwan?

559
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,499
The most exciting part of the knockout

560
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,539
is to switching the camp

561
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,539
in the second half.

562
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:52,539
The number of tokens that

563
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:53,580
the two camps grabbed in the first half

564
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:54,340
is a foregone conclusion.

565
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:55,900
The weaker camp

566
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,340
is unwilling to be eliminated,

567
00:24:57,739 --> 00:24:58,660
so they will snatch the cuff

568
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,180
of the opponent's camp.

569
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,539
Under the confirmation of the disciples

570
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,420
of the Nonuple Palace,

571
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:03,620
they can change the camp with the cuff.

572
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Isn't this a big mess?

573
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,299
They want the mess.

574
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,259
In fact,

575
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:11,620
it is unfair to eliminate half

576
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,539
of the contestants in the first round.

577
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:15,660
If you are on the weak camp,

578
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:17,340
you must go through the cruel choice

579
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,660
of either losing

580
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,060
or betraying the original camp.

581
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:22,459
Betray?

582
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,580
Isn't it just a competition?

583
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,299
For the martial heroes,

584
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:27,699
changing camps randomly

585
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:28,900
is no different from apostasy.

586
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,539
So,

587
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,140
they will not only be flanked

588
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,180
by the two camps in the game,

589
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:35,620
but will be scolded by people from all martial arts

590
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:36,979
and even all over the world after the game.

591
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,779
They will not switch camps

592
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,539
easily if they are

593
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,340
not in the last resort.

594
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,499
So this knockout

595
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,140
is not measuring the strength,

596
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:51,060
but people's hearts?

597
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,699
You are brilliant, Baiwan.

598
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,739
So, do you

599
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,860
want to lose

600
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:57,140
or carry the scolding

601
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,140
from the people around the world

602
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,100
to fight desperately?

603
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,620
That's your choice.

604
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,180
But luckily,

605
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,060
the red camp

606
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:03,939
you are in

607
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:05,420
is the weak camp,

608
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,900
and no one will attack you.

609
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,660
Shoot.

610
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,180
The red camp will undoubtedly lose

611
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,820
if this continues.

612
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:14,539
If you do want to win,

613
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:16,340
come to our blue camp.

614
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,219
I will welcome you

615
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:19,180
with my opened arms.

616
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:20,219
No way!

617
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,779
Want me to rebel?

618
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:22,660
Not a chance.

619
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:23,900
I can beat you even if

620
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,779
I don't change the camp.

621
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:26,340
Silly girl

622
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,779
The farther, the more dangerous it will be.

623
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,299
I can't put you in danger,

624
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,100
and I will win the Lingyao Herb for you.

625
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:32,820
What?

626
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,180
He switched to the red camp?

627
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:35,779
Yes.

628
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,539
The Young Host of Palace had been

629
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:39,140
helping the red team grab the tokens before.

630
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,580
It seems that he had planned for this earlier.

631
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,180
He represents for our Nonuple Palace,

632
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,820
how dare he

633
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:48,939
do such humiliating things

634
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,620
in front of the people of the world!

635
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,580
Maybe the Young Host of Palace

636
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:53,499
has his own consideration.

637
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,259
His consideration?

638
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:59,539
He was just

639
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:00,499
for that woman,

640
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,979
how dare he disobey me again and again!

641
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:13,060
Why is this gap getting bigger?

642
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,420
There are more and more rebels,

643
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,459
and the scoring gap

644
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,100
will be huge.

645
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:23,180
You think that the blue camp

646
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:23,979
is set to win,

647
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:24,979
so you deliberately make fun of me here,

648
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,660
don't you?

649
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:27,420
I said it before,

650
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,820
if you want to win,

651
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,219
you can switch your camp,

652
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:32,420
or just quit.

653
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,299
Until now,

654
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,219
you still want to stop me

655
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:36,900
from recovering my memory.

656
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,979
In your heart,

657
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:42,100
am I such a low life person?

658
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:44,380
This time,

659
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:46,100
you will not achieve your goal,

660
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,420
and I am bound to win the Lingyao Herb.

661
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:53,299
Why is it ringing again?

662
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
The third bell rang.

663
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,660
The game entered the 15 mins countdown.

664
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,499
You didn't learn any rules

665
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:00,539
of the Battle?

666
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:02,580
The last quarter

667
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:03,539
is the moment

668
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,380
to decide win or lose.

669
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:06,499
What do you mean?

670
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,820
The last quarter,

671
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,539
'course everyone will

672
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:11,420
show what he has got.

673
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:12,660
Everyone will use their own methods

674
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,219
to win the game.

675
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,340
If you

676
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,620
are unwilling to be eliminated,

677
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,299
then I advise you

678
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,100
to give it a go.

679
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,699
Count.

680
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,219
Qi

681
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:36,900
You actually...

682
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:38,979
I told you

683
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,459
I'll help you to get the Lingyao Herb.

684
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,860
I'm wondering

685
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,939
how you can make up the remaining tokens.

686
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,820
There are a total of 70 tokens here,

687
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,860
even if you find the rest,

688
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,219
it is not enough.

689
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:56,420
Be at ease.

690
00:28:57,699 --> 00:28:58,739
I will let you win.

691
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,219
You just said that

692
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,140
everyone can use

693
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,539
their own methods.

694
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,060
Does that mean that

695
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,060
the last 15 mins

696
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:18,699
is irrelevant to rules?

697
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,499
The Battle has its own rules.

698
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:23,580
What is that?

699
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,779
Not allowed to hurt the disciples of the Nonuple Palace.

700
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,979
Nothing more?

701
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,900
Nothing more.

702
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:28,620
Okay.

703
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,699
I see.

704
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:33,820
Do not follow me anymore.

705
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,259
If you dare to stop me from winning the Lingyao Herb,

706
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:37,820
I won't let you go.

707
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:42,499
Seems that

708
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,620
Miss Jin doesn't appreciate

709
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,580
your protection

710
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,979
along the way.

711
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,620
As a referee,

712
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:51,259
you just told me about the situation.

713
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,180
Is it fair to say?

714
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,699
I'm just doing things impartially.

715
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:58,459
Then I wish you

716
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
a success

717
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,660
in the game.

718
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:09,420
The selection of the blue camp

719
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
is indeed correct.

720
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:12,380
We have got it in the bag

721
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:13,580
this time.

722
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,420
Thanks to Qu Zheng,

723
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:16,219
most of our tokens here

724
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,580
are sent by him.

725
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:19,539
Go ahead, let's look over there.

726
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:30,340
Who's that?

727
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,060
It's me.

728
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:33,459
Brother, don't kill me.

729
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,060
Don't kill me.

730
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,219
If you are not here to hand in tokens,

731
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:36,259
why are you here?

732
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,459
Someone is chasing me

733
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,739
all the way,

734
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:39,779
so I can only come

735
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,060
to the place of your Nonuple Palace.

736
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:41,979
In this competition,

737
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:43,699
we Nonuple Palace will only be the judges.

738
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,939
We do not participate in the competitions.

739
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,180
I heard that

740
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,140
as long as people from Nonuple Palace won't be hurt

741
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,739
at the last 15 mins,

742
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:52,340
all other rules can be broken,

743
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,820
is that so?

744
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,779
So what?

745
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,219
Then take a look,

746
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:56,299
what is this?

747
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,699
I'm sorry,

748
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,259
I just fainted you,

749
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:01,620
it shouldn't be a foul, right?

750
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:02,420
I can't be eliminated

751
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:03,499
in the first round.

752
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:10,900
With these tokens,

753
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
our red camp will certainly win.

754
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,499
You chick

755
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,660
How dare you

756
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,140
to grab tokens in front of us?

757
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,900
If you are smart,

758
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:19,739
put down the tokens.

759
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,259
That's him.

760
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,900
He was

761
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,539
in blue camp,

762
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:27,060
but he grabbed a lot of tokens

763
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,620
from us and handed them to the red camp.

764
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,820
It turns out that

765
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,620
you were ready to betray before.

766
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,100
Isn't he the Young Host of Palace

767
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:34,860
of the Nonuple Palace?

768
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,860
In the Battle of martial arts by the lake,

769
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,979
who cares who he is.

770
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:38,259
As the Young Host of Palace,

771
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:38,939
you did such

772
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,380
disgraced move.

773
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,299
Is it a humiliation to

774
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:42,779
Nonuple Palace?

775
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,900
Shut your mouth!

776
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,100
Cut the crap,

777
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:45,860
let's go together!

778
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:48,539
Many of our red camp tokens

779
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,539
have been snatched by you.

780
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,499
We are all contestants,

781
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,499
why should I quit?

782
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:51,900
Bullsh*t,

783
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,259
You made the choice, right?

784
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,620
Don't get close!
