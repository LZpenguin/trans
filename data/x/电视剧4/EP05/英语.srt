10001
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

10002
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:40,278
Fall in Love with a Fox EP05

3
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Waiting for you for a long time.

4
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,019
That's right.

5
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,979
She is Jin Baiwan.

6
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:45,660
Don't worry.

7
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,379
I'm Qu Zheng from Tingqin Garden.

8
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,859
I wonder

9
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,379
why you are coming to the house

10
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,539
of Qing Songke today?

11
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,259
Qu Zheng

12
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,899
The Lord of Tingqin Garden is also here?

13
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:56,620
Whoever he is,

14
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,059
we are here for demanding fairness today.

15
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,219
Fairness?

16
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,460
What is that?

17
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,180
We heard that

18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,699
Jin Baiwan, the escort of the Jin's Escort Agency,

19
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,780
did an inside job.

20
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,340
In order to embezzle the Puyuan Canon,

21
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:08,059
she had killed the hero Qing Songke.

22
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,219
That's why we are here.

23
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,659
I...

24
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,579
The people in the village said that

25
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,740
Qing Songke has been dead for many years.

26
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:13,380
You have to find out the truth before you frame us.

27
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:14,420
How did you know?

28
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:16,339
In my view, it is you

29
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,259
to kill Qing Songke

30
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:18,579
for the Puyuan Canon.

31
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:19,820
Why are you

32
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,700
so unreasonable?

33
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,380
There's no need to

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,219
reason with them.

35
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:22,820
They are clearly here

36
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,820
for the Canon.

37
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,579
She has the Canon.

38
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,899
Give it to me!

39
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:40,700
That's mine.

40
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:41,419
Mine.

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,059
Mine.

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,539
What?

43
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,740
How...

44
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,139
How could this be?

45
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,259
Blank paper?

46
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,100
No.

47
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,580
Two pages are worded.

48
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,940
Is this Canon originally fake?

49
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,699
That must be Jin Baiwan

50
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,779
who changed the real one.

51
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:20,180
I...

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,300
Qing Songke doesn't exist.

53
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,940
And the Canon has only two pages left.

54
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,300
Instead,

55
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,100
you guys who were snatching for the Canon

56
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,059
fought with the gloves off.

57
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:37,820
Isn't it that clear?

58
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:38,499
Is it possible that

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,180
we were fallen into the trap?

60
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,699
If it wasn't for your greed and desire

61
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,779
to grab the Canon,

62
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,539
how would you fall into the trap?

63
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,659
This Canon thing is really strange,

64
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,659
for I am the Lord of Tingqin Garden,

65
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,740
it's my work to find out the truth.

66
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,140
But during this period,

67
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:52,700
if any of you

68
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,659
stand up to

69
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,980
against it in the name of justice.

70
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,300
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

71
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,180
Clear?

72
00:03:58,499 --> 00:03:59,300
Get away from here!

73
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,180
Get off!

74
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:01,540
Leave!

75
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,180
Go away!

76
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:02,740
Go away!

77
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,619
Get away!

78
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,300
How could it be?

79
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:09,700
It seems that

80
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,059
not just Qing Songke,

81
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,260
even the Puyuan Canon

82
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,300
you were escorting,

83
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:15,860
they are all fictitious.

84
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,260
What the hell is going on?

85
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,700
You don't understand?

86
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,460
This is clearly a scam.

87
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:22,980
Only you can't figure it out.

88
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
How?

89
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,099
This is

90
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,499
the secret box of our Jin's Escort Agency.

91
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,099
Do you still think

92
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,020
that someone wants to exchange

93
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,379
your precious Canon?

94
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,339
This is clearly two pieces of waste paper.

95
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,219
Stupid.

96
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:37,700
My task

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,140
is to escort the Canon.

98
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,059
Whether it's real or fake,

99
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,460
I need to take it to the owner.

100
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,059
Only in this way can the mission be fulfilled.

101
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:52,779
Mr Qu

102
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,980
So now,

103
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:54,860
what should we do?

104
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,260
The situation has changed.

105
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,659
Miss Su, you must go back

106
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:58,499
to Yan School immediately,

107
00:04:58,819 --> 00:04:59,700
and tell all the Grandmasters

108
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:00,619
about the current situation.

109
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:01,460
Would you

110
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,260
go with me?

111
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:03,659
I have something important to do.

112
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,219
I'm afraid you have to go alone.

113
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,460
No way.

114
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:07,659
I can't let you two

115
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,580
stay alone.

116
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:21,140
Miss Su

117
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Do you think I'm here

118
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,099
for an outing this time?

119
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:25,460
Of course not!

120
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Okay.

121
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,260
I'll go back to Yan School.

122
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,379
That would be good.

123
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:33,420
You...

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,420
Are you driving me away?

125
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,420
I'll leave if that's what you want.

126
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,540
She...

127
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,099
I'm leaving.

128
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:45,619
Why did she go?

129
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,219
Mr Qu

130
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:48,939
So,

131
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:49,659
where are we going then?

132
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,059
Given the current situation,

133
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,379
I am afraid there is no reason

134
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
that I go with you.

135
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:55,619
Why?

136
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:57,059
The Canon have been delivered,

137
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,499
so our mission is over.

138
00:05:58,819 --> 00:05:59,939
Time to say goodbye.

139
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,220
But...

140
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,819
No one has signed

141
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:04,819
the receipt of my escort.

142
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,420
How could it be finished?

143
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,019
Qing Songke is dead,

144
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,340
who else could you find

145
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:11,699
to sign the receipt?

146
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:14,499
Mr Qu

147
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,660
How boring would you be if you go alone?

148
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,059
You should find someone to accompany you.

149
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,379
It's definitely easier for me

150
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,180
to go alone

151
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,059
than being with you.

152
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,619
But didn't you hear

153
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,259
those guys said

154
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,139
they suspected that I replaced the Canon?

155
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:30,180
If someone observes me secretly,

156
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,699
what should I do?

157
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,579
But didn't you say

158
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:34,980
that when the Canon is delivered,

159
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,540
we will have nothing to do with each other.

160
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,939
I know

161
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,619
that you won't leave me in the lurch.

162
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,180
The situation has changed.

163
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,420
It might be more dangerous

164
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,619
for you to go with me.

165
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:49,619
Miss Jin

166
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,860
Take care of yourself.

167
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,860
Fine.

168
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,980
Do you really think

169
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,100
I can't get out of this wood

170
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:58,939
without you?

171
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,100
I have my own way.

172
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,180
Fake?

173
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:20,780
There are only two broken pages in the Canon.

174
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,900
So those guys

175
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:22,740
all left.

176
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,900
Did you see what has happened?

177
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,420
Yes, I did.

178
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:29,740
There are indeed only two pages.

179
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,139
That's it.

180
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,220
Finally, it's the time.

181
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,740
The Canon is genuine?

182
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,900
I will fetch it immediately.

183
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:38,660
Wait...

184
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,499
Such confidentiality,

185
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,660
of course,

186
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,340
the fewer people know it, the better.

187
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,499
The man wore a mask,

188
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,499
so I couldn't see his face.

189
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,139
He should be the leader of the group

190
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,100
at the lantern festival.

191
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,540
But,

192
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,699
he did not bring more people

193
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:03,619
this time.

194
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,100
He must be the one

195
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,100
we are waiting for.

196
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,780
Dad

197
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:18,740
Dad

198
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,180
What's wrong with you, Dad?

199
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,180
Dad

200
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,300
Puyuan Canon.

201
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:09,900
Who are you?

202
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,980
He really doesn't go with me.

203
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,900
The hell of Lord of Tingqin Garden.

204
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:20,900
The hell hero.

205
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,420
He even doesn't care about me.

206
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,180
What a man!

207
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:25,780
Will he come?

208
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:28,459
He will.

209
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:37,340
Oh no.

210
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,300
Someone really followed me.

211
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,499
Hello lady, that Puyuan Canon,

212
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,699
I really don't have it.

213
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,619
By the way, the Canon is fake.

214
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
If you don't believe me,

215
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,819
you can go ask Qu Zheng.

216
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,499
I'm looking for you.

217
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,579
Are you here to watch the show?

218
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,100
Move.

219
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,900
How come

220
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,660
I leave you here alone.

221
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,019
We just meet by chance.

222
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:08,540
Save those formalities.

223
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:54,780
I know you will come.

224
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,380
You have been practicing

225
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,339
kung fu from all genres,

226
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,180
why don't you dare to show your true face?

227
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,020
Okay.

228
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,059
Since you want to die,

229
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,979
I will show you

230
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,339
what I've got.

231
00:11:58,979 --> 00:11:59,500
This is...

232
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,099
We have no issues,

233
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,540
why do you want to kill us?

234
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:30,500
In the past five years,

235
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,140
I have been longing to

236
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,579
kill you in person.

237
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,819
You can restrain my palm power?

238
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:24,660
It's him.

239
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:25,979
I know

240
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:26,859
he won't leave me alone.

241
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,699
Who are you?

242
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:09,540
This is

243
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,979
the question

244
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:11,819
I want to ask you.

245
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:27,859
Miss Jin, are you OK?

246
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,780
Yeah.

247
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:33,500
Where's the hero?

248
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,859
Hero?

249
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,939
The one who saved me just now.

250
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,939
Why did he leave without saying a word?

251
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,099
The hero who saved you

252
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,380
is in front of you,

253
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,739
you are still looking for another hero?

254
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,339
I did not mean that.

255
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:49,500
But...

256
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,459
You just gave your life to save me,

257
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,020
did you get hurt?

258
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,699
Thank you for your asking,

259
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,059
I'm fine.

260
00:15:58,859 --> 00:15:59,780
I know

261
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:01,660
you are chivalrous-heart,

262
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:03,059
and will never be as cold

263
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:03,979
as you say.

264
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,900
You will come.

265
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:06,819
I just happened

266
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:07,739
to pass by here.

267
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:09,579
Since you and I are all safe,

268
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,300
then I will...

269
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,699
Mr Qu

270
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,579
This forest

271
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:17,579
is so dangerous.

272
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,260
It will be more dangerous

273
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,300
if we keep staying here.

274
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,780
How about

275
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:23,420
going to the inn before?

276
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,300
Okay.

277
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,699
Mr Qu, after you.

278
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,059
I didn't expect to

279
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,660
be in the same room with you tonight.

280
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,939
Hope you don't mind.

281
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,339
Living in a room is just convenient for me

282
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:01,380
to seize the last chance.

283
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:02,859
I must convince him.

284
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,979
Mr Qu

285
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,380
I have heard of your reputation

286
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,939
when I was in the Escort Agency.

287
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,979
What did you hear

288
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,219
about me?

289
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:17,900
This is what my family young lady said.

290
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,180
Qu Zheng, hero Qu.

291
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,579
Took the lead in the Wuhu Meeting

292
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,859
three years ago,

293
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,780
and founded Tingqin Garden.

294
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:28,099
That is invincible,

295
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,140
and unparalleled.

296
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,140
He is a genius at Wuhu Meeting.

297
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,739
You know a lot.

298
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,020
Mr Qu

299
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,620
It's late,

300
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:37,780
please go to bed early.

301
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:39,579
Mr Qu

302
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,579
Mr Qu

303
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,300
You didn't ask me

304
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,819
to send you back to the Jin's Escort Agency.

305
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:45,900
It's because the Canon thing

306
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:46,819
has not been ascertained yet.

307
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,620
If you go back now,

308
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:49,819
you will only drag down the Escort Agency.

309
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,780
The Jin's Escort Agency,

310
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,099
I'm afraid you can't go back.

311
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,459
Mr Qu

312
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,260
Will you send me to Taoyuan Valley?

313
00:17:59,219 --> 00:17:59,819
I can't.

314
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,059
Really can't.

315
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:04,939
Why?

316
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,339
Because of my family affairs.

317
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,260
Family affairs?

318
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,380
What's that like?

319
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:13,900
I fought off the gangsters for you

320
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,699
this morning,

321
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:15,900
now I'm really sleepy.

322
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,540
If you still have questions,

323
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,260
we might as well talk about it tomorrow.

324
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,260
Mr Qu, you haven't told me

325
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,099
why you can't go.

326
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,219
I'm too sleepy.

327
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:25,420
Mr Qu

328
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:26,819
Mr Qu

329
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:28,739
Mr Qu

330
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,180
How could you fall asleep in a second?

331
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Are you deliberately annoying me?

332
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:04,860
Based on the injuries,

333
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,739
even I can't tell

334
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,739
which genre of Kung Fu it came.

335
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,380
It even hurt your meridians.

336
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,660
The Majesty's supernatural power is so superb,

337
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:13,739
is there really anyone

338
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,539
who can hurt the Majesty?

339
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,620
However,

340
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:18,779
most of the meridians of the Majesty

341
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:20,779
are backed up by his own palm power.

342
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,100
It can be seen that this person

343
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:25,499
is quite familiar with the Puyuan Canon.

344
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,860
Madam

345
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,019
Madam

346
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,380
With these Kung Fu Cheats,

347
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,019
how could our Nonuple Palace

348
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,340
be restrained

349
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:07,019
by Alliance of Martial Arts.

350
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,340
I...

351
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,060
I will be the martial arts chief in the future.

352
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,620
How could two pages be missing?

353
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,900
I was eager to dominate the martial arts world then,

354
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,660
even though two pieces were missing,

355
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,499
I still

356
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,459
practiced Puyuan Canon.

357
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
But I didn't expect this

358
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,420
has left me with so many troubles.

359
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,499
Although you have achieved those skills,

360
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,420
you cannot dissolve

361
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,380
the backlash of the Puyuan Canon

362
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,259
to your body.

363
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,539
So when the moon is surging or waning,

364
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,299
you will lose your mind on a regular basis.

365
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,699
Although I have made Vitality Pills

366
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,979
for the Majesty,

367
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:51,939
it can only relieve for a while.

368
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,100
I am afraid that

369
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,219
it will be more frequent in the future.

370
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:56,979
Of course, I know

371
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,100
that the last two pages of the Canon

372
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,699
are the key.

373
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,219
If not,

374
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,739
how could I

375
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,539
be calculated

376
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:09,539
by his little tricks.

377
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:12,299
My Majesty

378
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,660
When will our Majesty

379
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,459
be recovered?

380
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,939
This skin wound is not difficult to heal,

381
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,979
but the meridians are the most difficult.

382
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:21,779
Doctor Demon

383
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:23,140
Is there really

384
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:23,939
no other way?

385
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,459
Yes, there is.

386
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:30,699
Saussurea involucrata can heal this injury.

387
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:33,340
Now, Taoyuan Valley

388
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,019
has the last Saussurea involucrata in the world.

389
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,420
Taoyuan Valley

390
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:52,459
How is the investigation?

391
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,699
The spies in Tingqin Garden said

392
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,900
they have gone around for news.

393
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:57,340
Not only those

394
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:58,459
who fought you in Yinxue Village,

395
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,140
but the female assassin

396
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,699
who chased Miss Jin

397
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,620
is gone.

398
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,299
I'm not surprised at all.

399
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:05,140
Over the years,

400
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,140
they have been doing things cautiously.

401
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,140
It's that the female assassin

402
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,019
stroke deadly movements when chasing Miss Jin.

403
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,620
I felt like she did not come

404
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:12,499
for the Canon,

405
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,620
but more like a private vengeance.

406
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,219
Is it

407
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,459
related to that incident five years ago?

408
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,939
It's a pity that

409
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,100
we didn't catch them

410
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,979
in Yinxue Village.

411
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:25,620
Otherwise, we can figure out everything.

412
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,259
Don't worry.

413
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:33,180
You don't need to worry about this.

414
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,380
So you have your ways?

415
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,420
He took a palm of me,

416
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:37,499
so I'm sure,

417
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,299
he will

418
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,180
go to a place in a few days.

419
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,100
Which place?

420
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,620
Taoyuan Valley

421
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:44,779
Then why didn't you promise Miss Jin

422
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,100
and take her to Taoyuan Valley?

423
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,580
I will go of course.

424
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,699
But,

425
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,459
not with my current identity.

426
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:58,699
I see.

427
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:01,979
The woman you like

428
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,580
is so miserable.

429
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,219
Are you really

430
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:14,699
not going to Taoyuan Valley with me?

431
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:16,019
If I

432
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,979
go with you,

433
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,779
whether we meet people like Yu Chen,

434
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,939
or the killer yesterday,

435
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
I have to be distracted

436
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,860
to protect you all the time.

437
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:25,620
Not cost-effective.

438
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,259
Not exactly.

439
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,539
I was in front of you when Yu Chen was trying to stab you,

440
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:31,420
that is to say,

441
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,539
I am your savior.

442
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:33,660
You got the point.

443
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,060
As you protected me from being stabbed,

444
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:36,979
I do feel guilty.

445
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:39,699
So,

446
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:41,459
I almost died

447
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,420
because of you.

448
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,499
Shouldn't you pay me back

449
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,019
for such a great affection?

450
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Life-saving debt

451
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:47,779
must be paid back.

452
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:49,539
However,

453
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:52,420
I told you yesterday,

454
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,100
it's really because of

455
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:55,380
my family affairs.

456
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,739
What kind of family affairs?

457
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:57,620
I can help.

458
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,060
Miss Jin, I'm afraid you won't be able to help

459
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:00,979
with this problem.

460
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,860
You are the hero yesterday.

461
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:06,820
Forgot to introduce him to you.

462
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:08,180
He's my dark guard,

463
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:09,299
Song Jianshan.

464
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,299
Dark guard?

465
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:12,620
So yesterday?

466
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,140
That was my Lord

467
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:15,180
who asked me to save you.

468
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,259
If you want to thank,

469
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:17,620
you can thank him.

470
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,299
It turned out

471
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,340
that he didn't leave me alone

472
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:21,820
in the woods yesterday.

473
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,380
Miss Jin, it's great that you are here.

474
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,820
Help me find out a way

475
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,299
to let my Lord go home

476
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,620
for a blind date.

477
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,180
A blind date?

478
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,699
Go back home for a blind date?

479
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:36,900
When my parents were alive,

480
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,380
they asked me to get married

481
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,219
before I was 25.

482
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:43,299
But until now,

483
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:44,459
I am still single.

484
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:47,019
It's really ashamed to say it.

485
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:48,900
So, my Lord.

486
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,380
You must go back to Tingqin Garden with me

487
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:51,420
for a blind date.

488
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,939
Is this your family affair?

489
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,100
Yes.

490
00:24:58,459 --> 00:24:58,900
But...

491
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,779
You are the Lord of Tingqin Garden,

492
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,180
why are you forced to go on a blind date?

493
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,660
Parents' orders cannot be violated.

494
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,180
Besides, my parents are no longer alive.

495
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,660
I can't bear

496
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,060
to see them still restless

497
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:10,380
for worrying about me.

498
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,979
But escorting the Canon

499
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,779
is also a top-notch event

500
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:16,779
in the martial arts world.

501
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,459
Nothing could be important

502
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,380
than that

503
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:20,620
of my Lord's marriage.

504
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
Isn't it, my Lord?

505
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:24,499
Marriage

506
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,499
cannot be hasty.

507
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,699
My 25th birthday

508
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,699
will be in next month.

509
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,259
This can only be done like this

510
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,979
as things are urgently followed.

511
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:32,060
But...

512
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,860
It's great if you can figure it out.

513
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,660
Tomorrow I will ask our disciples

514
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,979
to send the portraits of the girls

515
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,420
as the suitable age from noble families

516
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,299
for you to choose.

517
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,699
You should marry

518
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,939
someone you like.

519
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,580
Yeah.

520
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:46,380
Then you can

521
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:47,420
pick a girl you like.

522
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:49,580
Do you like heart-shaped face

523
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:50,420
or round face?

524
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,259
Big eyes

525
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,100
or small eyes?

526
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:52,580
But...

527
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,539
But...

528
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:54,180
But what?

529
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,539
When it comes to my Lord's marriage,

530
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:57,979
why are you trying to stop?

531
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,539
You like him?

532
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:05,019
I, I'm not.

533
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,140
That's a pity.

534
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:06,820
Otherwise,

535
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:08,019
I can finish the task earlier.

536
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,380
However,

537
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,060
I should thank you for helping me.

538
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,539
If it weren't for your help, Miss Jin,

539
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,620
I wouldn't be able to

540
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:15,580
persuade my Lord so quickly.

541
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:16,420
Me?

542
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,860
Now that you have agreed,

543
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:18,779
we can't wait.

544
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:19,660
Let's set off now

545
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,259
to go back to Tingqin Garden.

546
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,939
My Lord

547
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,779
Everything is ready,

548
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:26,939
and we can set off right away.

549
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,259
Mr Qu

550
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,939
Are you really leaving now?

551
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,499
Miss Jin, you have seen it too,

552
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,499
I have no choice.

553
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:38,420
I know,

554
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,900
you actually don't want to go.

555
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,900
How about I take you to escape?

556
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:44,699
Thank you, Miss Jin.

557
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,939
But this matter

558
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,259
is about my parents' death wish,

559
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,660
and there is no way to hide.

560
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:49,979
Unless,

561
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,180
this marriage thing can be done,

562
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,180
I don't want to give a hard time on Jianshan.

563
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,380
But, you don't have to rush

564
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,060
to leave, right?

565
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,299
Sooner or later, we still say goodbye.

566
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:04,299
Maybe just as you said,

567
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,380
no matter where,

568
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,620
we will never see each other again

569
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,420
W... What do you mean?

570
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,699
We won't meet each other any more?

571
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,060
Yes.

572
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,140
But you're right,

573
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,380
for you saving my life,

574
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,060
I feel guilty of you.

575
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:20,219
If you have any needs

576
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:20,939
in the future,

577
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,459
you can come to me in Tingqin Garden any time.

578
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,060
You don't need to see me off.

579
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:25,580
Take care.

580
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:41,580
Miss Jin

581
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:43,900
I'll see you again.

582
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:14,699
No matter where,

583
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
we will never see each other.

584
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,340
Is that mean I will never see him again?

585
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:05,860
Wait!

586
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,539
Mr Qu

587
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,219
Mr Qu

588
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,620
What else do you want to say?

589
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:37,860
Is it that as long as you get married,

590
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,180
you don't have to go?

591
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:40,939
Yes.

592
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,299
Then marry me.

593
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:52,539
If you don't want,

594
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,380
just pretend that I didn't say it.

595
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,660
I do.

596
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:12,699
What did you say?

597
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,820
I said I do.
