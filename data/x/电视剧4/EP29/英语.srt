00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:40,167
Fall in Love with a Fox EP29

3
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,780
Why don't you fight back?

4
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:02,859
Because it is you.

5
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,579
I won't regret it.

6
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,660
Zijing

7
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,899
I'm sorry.

8
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,180
Qingyun

9
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,580
Qingyun

10
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,139
Qingyun

11
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,419
Qingyun

12
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:28,300
Qingyun

13
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,100
Qingyun

14
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,779
Qingyun

15
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:32,460
Zheng

16
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,059
Thank you

17
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:35,740
for sparing Qingyun's life just now.

18
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,300
He was just like you.

19
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,779
Being deceived.

20
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,059
So he's done too many bad things.

21
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:44,140
What's more,

22
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,260
he is blind now.

23
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,180
He gets what he deserves.

24
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,140
And most importantly,

25
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,860
I can't bear to see you

26
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,860
feel sorry

27
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,939
for another man.

28
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,779
He used to

29
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,580
be a good man.

30
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,499
Hope he'll repent and start anew.

31
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,460
Wait.

32
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:10,379
Zheng

33
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,020
You're still being poisoned.

34
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,939
We can't be so close.

35
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,499
But the forest is dangerous.

36
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,140
I can't let you go alone.

37
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,300
Ok, how about this?

38
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:23,860
You walk ahead,

39
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,740
and I follow you slowly.

40
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,100
Su Zhuozhuo said

41
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,139
that she had found

42
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,220
a new treatment for poisonous insects.

43
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,379
Maybe we should go back

44
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,980
to her.

45
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,139
Ok.

46
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,180
When you're cured,

47
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,780
I'll take you to Jin's Escort Agency.

48
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,499
Up to you.

49
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,660
Zheng, why do you stop?

50
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,220
Baiwan

51
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,819
Please feel free to cry.

52
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:41,939
I'm willing

53
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,619
to accompany you.

54
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,340
Zheng

55
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,220
I'm so upset.

56
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,499
Qingyun

57
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,819
is my only family

58
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,100
in Nonuple Palace.

59
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
We've lived together since childhood.

60
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:06,300
He's my brother.

61
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,900
He looked for me for five years.

62
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,900
After we met each other again,

63
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:16,900
I've never

64
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:18,780
talked to him patiently,

65
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,860
nor smiled at him.

66
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,660
Zheng

67
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,699
Since he went back,

68
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,100
he's been in a coma.

69
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,939
Is it because of the poison?

70
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,220
I felt the pulse for Lord Qu.

71
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,540
According to his pulse,

72
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,300
the poisonous insect has disappeared.

73
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,619
Disappeared?

74
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:02,660
The poison

75
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,540
is controlled by the blood of the person who poisoned.

76
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,259
The poisonous insect has disappeared,

77
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,379
which means

78
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,259
Qingyun, the person who poisoned him,

79
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,259
was dead too.

80
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,819
Dead?

81
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,100
So,

82
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,499
the poison has been neutralized?

83
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,420
But why is Zheng

84
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,100
still in a coma?

85
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,019
Let's talk inside.

86
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,019
Baiwan

87
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,059
Zhuozhuo

88
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,740
Please check Zheng.

89
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,420
Why is he still in a coma?

90
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,780
The poisonous insect in Lord Qu's body

91
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:36,980
was dead.

92
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,579
Your poison has disappeared.

93
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,100
Disappeared?

94
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:45,660
The poison has been neutralized,

95
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:46,660
but the residual poison

96
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,540
has hurt

97
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:49,059
his heart badly.

98
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,499
The injury is inside his body.

99
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:52,459
So, we have nothing to do but wait for him

100
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,780
to wake up.

101
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:55,499
But what if he can't?

102
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,059
No.

103
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,420
He'll be fine.

104
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,780
Since the poison has been neutralized,

105
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,540
he'll definitely wake up.

106
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,420
We will go outside.

107
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,860
Let's go.

108
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,379
Zheng, did you hear that?

109
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,300
Your poison has been neutralized.

110
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,619
Could you please wake up?

111
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,139
You're a man.

112
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,340
Stop crying.

113
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,100
Is it true

114
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,540
that Zheng can't wake up?

115
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,900
Maybe

116
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,139
he'll wake up soon.

117
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:07,780
Maybe

118
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,900
he'll wake up long after now.

119
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,099
Ok,

120
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:13,099
I'll stay before he wakes up.

121
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,339
Fine.

122
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:16,780
I'll be here with you

123
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,979
and wait for him to wake up.

124
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,979
Please straighten your back.

125
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,339
Straighten your back.

126
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,620
Higher.

127
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:48,859
Cunning fox

128
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:53,180
You've slept clock around.

129
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,020
When will you

130
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,500
wake up?

131
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,180
When you wake up,

132
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,660
I'll make your favorite pastry.

133
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:05,540
We'll go to watch the shadow play.

134
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,540
Go for an outing to Mount Jiufeng.

135
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,140
Go

136
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:10,540
where we've never been

137
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,099
together...

138
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,180
Or

139
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
we can just stay in Tingqin Garden.

140
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,819
You're the lord,

141
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,540
and I'm your dear wife

142
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,859
to the end of our life.

143
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:26,699
Forever and ever.

144
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:28,819
Zheng

145
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:38,059
When will you wake up?

146
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,819
Ok,

147
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,540
no matter where do you want to go,

148
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,819
I'll be with you.

149
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,459
Cunning fox, you're awake.

150
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,300
My wife wants me to wake up,

151
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:10,420
so I have to.

152
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,260
Do you still feel bad?

153
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,059
Do you still have any pain?

154
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,219
I'll find Zhuozhuo to check you.

155
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:24,500
If you leave now,

156
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:26,859
I'll feel bad.

157
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,699
Baiwan

158
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,180
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,339
I made you worried.

160
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,459
If you do this again,

161
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,979
I'll never talk to you again.

162
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,699
I won't.

163
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:43,660
I'll be with you

164
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,219
from now on.

165
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,579
OK?

166
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,380
OK.

167
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,420
From now on,

168
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:55,699
No troubles will

169
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,500
happen to us.

170
00:12:58,739 --> 00:12:59,739
We'll

171
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,219
live a peaceful life

172
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,300
till the last breath of our life.

173
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,059
Forever in faith.

174
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:10,260
Dependent life and death.

175
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,939
Be together,

176
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,859
and grow old together.

177
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,579
Ok.

178
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,260
Good morning, Mr and Mrs. lord.

179
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,699
Since then,

180
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,219
I really did what I said.

181
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:21,819
I stayed in Tingqin Garden

182
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,059
and became the hostess here.

183
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,300
And Zheng and me

184
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:28,260
was all good.

185
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:29,660
We are happy.

186
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,140
The division of labor was also very clear.

187
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:36,380
At the beginning of every month

188
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,979
was the routine meeting.

189
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,180
If you have something to report,

190
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:40,500
just do it.

191
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:45,260
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Lord,

192
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,540
the end of the month is the day

193
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:47,900
to report the spending.

194
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,900
This is the account book.

195
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,699
From now on,

196
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,059
all of the dealings in Tingqin Garden

197
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,819
will be handled by Mrs. Qu.

198
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:56,140
Yes.

199
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:08,620
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Lord,

200
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:11,059
The farmers who rents our lands down the hill

201
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:11,819
haven't paid the rent

202
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:12,819
for two months.

203
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,699
From now on,

204
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,300
all property leases

205
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:17,780
in Tingqin Garden

206
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,540
will also be handled by Mrs. Qu.

207
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:20,979
Yes.

208
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:25,300
There's a flood down the hill last month.

209
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:26,660
They don't

210
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:28,339
mean to fall into arrears.

211
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,420
I'll check the situation tomorrow.

212
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:31,859
The rent doesn't matter.

213
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,579
It's important to know

214
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:36,380
how they are now.

215
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:37,819
Yes.

216
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,620
Mrs. Qu is kind,

217
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,459
doing things in an orderly manner.

218
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,380
I'm totally convinced.

219
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,819
In other places,

220
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,020
people are correcting their conduct

221
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,500
and trying to live a good life.

222
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,420
Rock Paper Scissors!

223
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,699
Rock Paper Scissors!

224
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:56,459
Envoy Xueyue is back.

225
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,819
Hurry up.

226
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:59,020
Envoy Xueyue

227
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,819
I've told you

228
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:00,540
don't call her like that.

229
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,939
Nonuple Palace

230
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:02,660
is gone now.

231
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,579
You shouldn't call her Envoy Xueyue.

232
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:06,339
We should call her Sister Zijing.

233
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,020
Sister Zijing.

234
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,140
Good.

235
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:11,859
You're so smart.

236
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:13,219
From now on,

237
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,819
there's no Envoy Xueyue,

238
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,819
and you're not

239
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,180
the disciples of Nonuple Palace anymore.

240
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,579
You can

241
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:20,579
live a happy life and receive good education here.

242
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,339
Sister Zijing

243
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,939
We've performed well today.

244
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,099
The teacher said

245
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,020
we were getting better.

246
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,660
So,

247
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,180
what did the teacher teach you today?

248
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,140
We learnt

249
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,699
no one's perfect and all is good

250
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,939
if on can correct the mistakes.

251
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,979
The meaning is

252
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,459
we all make mistakes,

253
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,380
but if we can correct the mistakes,

254
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,819
we'll be good.

255
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,339
But

256
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,859
why don't we

257
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:42,979
practice martial skills anymore

258
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,579
and need to study?

259
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:46,540
Education is to help you

260
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,739
to figure out

261
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:48,660
what you want to do,

262
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:50,819
and what kind of person you want to be

263
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,699
in the future.

264
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,540
Don't be like me,

265
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,380
wasting half a lifetime

266
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,939
to figure these out.

267
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:02,660
Ok,

268
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,620
you must be hungry.

269
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,260
Let's have dinner first.

270
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:06,420
After dinner,

271
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,380
you can eat the Baiyu pastry I bought.

272
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,979
Great!

273
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,939
Here.

274
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,339
I want it, too.

275
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,099
Me too.

276
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,059
I can't reach it.

277
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,300
Let me help you.

278
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Thank you.

279
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:23,500
Try this.

280
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:24,819
It's good.

281
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,660
Yummy!

282
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Oh, it fell on my clothes.

283
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,260
This is your favorite.

284
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,020
I still remember.

285
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:49,780
I took the kids

286
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:50,939
here.

287
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:52,699
Every day is noisy.

288
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:54,579
You must be upset.

289
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,780
I had a dream last night that you scolded me.

290
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,219
You were always so strict.

291
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,979
You never smiled when you saw me.

292
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:04,819
So I couldn't

293
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:05,979
recall your smile

294
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,900
in my dream every night.

295
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,300
But I'm satisfied

296
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:13,739
to see you

297
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,020
in my dream every day.

298
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,300
My drumstick fell off.

299
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,900
It's ok, you can eat mine.

300
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,059
Let's split it.

301
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,020
Ok.

302
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,020
What are you doing?

303
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,540
Nothing!

304
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,500
If we didn't

305
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:33,459
grow up in Nonuple Palace

306
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,660
but lived a life like them,

307
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,979
would the end

308
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,500
will be different?

309
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,259
But at least, after they grow up,

310
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:42,900
they won't

311
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,259
repeat our destiny.

312
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,739
It's great.

313
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:48,660
Sister Zijing

314
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,660
Why don't you have dinner?

315
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,820
I'm not hungry.

316
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,060
Sister Zijing

317
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,860
Why do you

318
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,180
always talk to this tombstone?

319
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,739
Who's under the tombstone?

320
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,420
He is someone

321
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,779
who likes eating Baiyu pastry

322
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,380
and

323
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,779
someone I like so much.

324
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,140
You like him so much.

325
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:13,340
Sister Zijing

326
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:15,180
Let's go to have dinner.

327
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,660
Ok.

328
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,219
Stop, stop running.

329
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,140
Dinner time.

330
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,259
Hurry up.

331
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,420
It's dinner time.

332
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:24,100
Let's start the dinner.

333
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,820
Wow.

334
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:31,180
Here, try this.

335
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Is it good?

336
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,299
Yes.

337
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:50,340
Why are you looking at me?

338
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,340
Because you're pretty.

339
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I know that.

340
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,820
Since you knew it,

341
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,100
stop writing.

342
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,180
What?

343
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,459
I feel so happy

344
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:05,340
to just look at you like this.

345
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:23,979
Mom

346
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:24,939
Mom

347
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,699
Fenger, leave us.

348
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,779
I want to talk to Qiuer.

349
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:30,699
Mom

350
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,459
But...

351
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,620
Are you writing the novel?

352
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,420
No, I'm not.

353
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,939
I'm practicing calligraphy with Shu.

354
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:52,660
You...

355
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,620
Why don't you write?

356
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,299
The book "I'm in Charge of the Garden for My Husband"

357
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,779
hasn't been updated for so long.

358
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,060
You said

359
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,019
we should get to know each other better,

360
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,979
and asked me

361
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:05,860
to read your novels.

362
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,019
You don't pay attention to your novels.

363
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,299
Why do you want me to read?

364
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,420
Mom, I'm sorry.

365
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:12,779
If you want to read it,

366
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,459
I'll write it soon.

367
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,820
But,

368
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,620
don't you think novels

369
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,979
are coarse now?

370
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:24,900
Well,

371
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,299
things can't be generalized.

372
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,820
Although the language is straightforward,

373
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,979
the story is new

374
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,620
and genuine.

375
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,939
But don't tell your father

376
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,539
that I read the novels.

377
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,100
Mom

378
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,259
Relax. It's a secret

379
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,739
between you and me.

380
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,580
I didn't even tell

381
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,420
Shu about it.

382
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,380
It's our little secret.

383
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,420
Qiuer

384
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:52,620
Since you need to write novels,

385
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,539
you can skip

386
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:55,820
the daily courtesies.

387
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:56,939
But,

388
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,259
you have to promise

389
00:21:58,459 --> 00:21:59,420
the speed and quality of your update.

390
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:03,620
After I read your novel,

391
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,420
I found something that you can

392
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,860
improve.

393
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,180
Well, do you want my advice?

394
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,939
Of course, I want.

395
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,900
Look at this paragraph.

396
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,580
It's said

397
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:24,539
that the hostess scolded the servants.

398
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,019
How could she wear a

399
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,340
feather skirt with flowers on it?

400
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,340
How can such a costume

401
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:29,660
convince servants?

402
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,620
Am I right?

403
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,739
Yes, you're right!

404
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,539
Well,

405
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,779
and this one.

406
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,499
Zheng, try this.

407
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,539
I made it myself.

408
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,019
How's it? Delicious?

409
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,820
Of course, it's tasty.

410
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,019
Next month Zhuozhuo and Jianshan will

411
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,299
come back from their rounds of visits.

412
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,340
And I invited Mr Yu and Miss over

413
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:49,979
to celebrate the Mid-autumn Festival.

414
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,019
Muqiu's pregnant.

415
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,459
But the gender of the baby

416
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,060
is not clear.

417
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,660
Well... If it's you,

418
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,499
do you want a boy or a girl?

419
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,459
I have no idea.

420
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,699
We're so busy.

421
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,259
There's no time.

422
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:08,660
Yes,

423
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,979
we're so busy lately.

424
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:12,499
But,

425
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,019
we're free now.

426
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,539
What are you talking about?

427
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,699
No rush.

428
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,660
Mr Yu and Mrs. Yu

429
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,060
are about to have a baby.

430
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:25,699
We can't fall behind.

431
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,140
Stop talking nonsense.

432
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,939
Focus on eating.

433
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:32,739
It's all over your mouth.

434
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,180
Baiwan

435
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:42,660
I want a little girl

436
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,459
who is charming and cute

437
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,219
as you're.

438
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:46,580
Can you

439
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:47,779
make my wish come true?

440
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:49,860
What if it's a boy?

441
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,779
No,

442
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,939
I don't want a boy.

443
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,699
So if it's a boy,

444
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,860
will you abandon him?

445
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,219
What are you doing?

446
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:01,939
Take it as bribery.

447
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,779
What kind of bribery is it?

448
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,820
Enough?

449
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,340
The gender of the baby

450
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:13,900
isn't under my control.

451
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:15,820
I'll give it back to you.

452
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,860
Wait for me.

453
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:22,860
Things are quite good

454
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,699
in Yan School.

455
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,499
Why do we rush back to Tingqin Garden?

456
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,939
I'm sending you back to Tingqin Garden.

457
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,459
If you stay any longer in Yan School,

458
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,420
my parents will be yours.

459
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,860
Yes, I'm so charming.

460
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:36,340
How dare you.

461
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:37,939
You're a man.

462
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,779
Why did you

463
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:40,900
cry in front of my parents

464
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,860
for such a small thing?

465
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:42,820
Do you feel shameless?

466
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:43,779
That's because

467
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:45,140
you always bully me.

468
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,699
At least your parents

469
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,180
could fight for me in Yan School.

470
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,739
By the way,

471
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,499
they told me

472
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,739
to get married to you soon.

473
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:53,299
Shut up!

474
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:54,420
And,

475
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,019
you took so many things.

476
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,140
They're

477
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,140
the love of your parents.

478
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,100
They told me

479
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:04,140
to take it on my way.

480
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:07,060
You take nothing with you to Yan School.

481
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,539
But now you took

482
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:10,620
so much stuff back.

483
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,019
You're the most shameless person

484
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,580
in the world.

485
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:15,420
Yes, I'm shameless.

486
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,860
But you like me.

487
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,140
Zhuozhuo, wait.

488
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:19,699
Go away.

489
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,860
When will

490
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,580
we go back to Yan School again?

491
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:22,219
Don't ask me.

492
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,019
Your parents really like me.

493
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,140
Shut up.

494
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,019
I really like your parents.

495
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,620
I mean it.

496
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,180
Qiuqiu

497
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,820
Qiuer, Qiuer

498
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:29,779
Miss

499
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,979
Be careful.

500
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,860
Be careful.

501
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:35,699
Oh, oh,

502
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,699
slow down, slow down.

503
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:37,660
Miss

504
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,100
Baiwan

505
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,699
You're

506
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,459
Mrs. Qu, the hostess of Tingqin Garden now.

507
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,820
Why do you still call me like this?

508
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:45,140
No matter who I'm,

509
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,699
you're still my boss.

510
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:47,939
Zhuozhuo

511
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,979
I heard that you've brought the Song Jianshan back

512
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,779
to Yan School and see your parents.

513
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,380
How's it?

514
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,060
Did they

515
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,699
agree with your marriage?

516
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,060
My parents were so happy

517
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,060
to meet him.

518
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:57,979
Certainly.

519
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,019
Mr Yu

520
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,979
Long time no see.

521
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:02,019
I heard Mrs. Yu is pregnant.

522
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:02,779
Congratulations!

523
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:03,459
Thank you.

524
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,499
Congratulations!

525
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,580
Let's go.

526
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,420
Let's find a place to talk.

527
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,100
Ok.

528
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:07,739
Let's go.

529
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:08,820
Be careful.

530
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:11,380
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival.

531
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,340
You've gone.

532
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,100
What should we do?

533
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:14,539
Make moon cakes of course.

534
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,459
You should know it.

535
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,499
That's right.

536
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:17,420
Yes.

537
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:18,699
Shu

538
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,420
I don't eat moon cakes with assorted nuts.

539
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,299
Please rest assured.

540
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,340
I'll make

541
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,779
many moon cakes with sweet bean paste.

542
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:25,259
I'll go.

543
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:27,140
Go.

544
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,420
I heard it.

545
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:34,660
He's talking to me.

546
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,420
Stop exaggerating.

547
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:38,939
He's so young.

548
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,299
Age doesn't matter.

549
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,019
Quantities do.

550
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,699
Quantities?

551
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,180
You mean

552
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,620
there're

553
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,820
twins?

554
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:51,580
No need to surprise.

555
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,140
Look at how Lord Qu

556
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,499
treats you.

557
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,100
Maybe you will have to become pregnant soon.

558
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:00,979
I'm not in a hurry yet.

559
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:02,380
I feel that

560
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,900
it's good to be the hostess.

561
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,299
I could not only guide the disciples to

562
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,299
punish the evil,

563
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:08,979
but also protect the place and

564
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,499
expand Tingqin Garden.

565
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
They're more interesting than having a baby.

566
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:15,820
Yes,

567
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,340
it's called

568
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:18,900
career.

569
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,459
Yes.

570
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:20,699
Listen.

571
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,820
I'm getting better in

572
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:23,820
writing novels.

573
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,820
Even my mother-in-law

574
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,019
starts to read

575
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,100
my novels now.

576
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:28,979
Really?

577
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:30,900
Actually,

578
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,180
when she was young,

579
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,019
she also dreamed of receiving a good education,

580
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,660
so she now

581
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,100
support me to write novels privately.

582
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,459
So,

583
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,779
we women should

584
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:41,499
work hard on our careers.

585
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:41,979
Right.

586
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:43,100
Let me tell you.

587
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:44,299
When Song Jianshan was with me

588
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,420
during the rounds of visits,

589
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,140
after people knew that he's my husband,

590
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,620
they were impressed by him.

591
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,180
He's so proud of that.

592
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,219
Yes,

593
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,539
men should not be the only one to work outside.

594
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:54,420
Women should take the turn now.

595
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,979
I think it's good

596
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,860
to let them make moon cakes.

597
00:27:58,699 --> 00:27:59,259
Well...

598
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,739
How about we take a look

599
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,499
how they are going?

600
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:06,140
Is there anything

601
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:07,979
we could help?

602
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,660
Miss

603
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:09,979
You're the least promising.

604
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,259
Coward.

605
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,979
You should say

606
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:13,699
"Let's go

607
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,900
and see

608
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
how's their cooking."

609
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,459
and "Is it to our taste?"

610
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,459
Right.

611
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,180
Let's go.

612
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:21,739
Slow down.

613
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,860
Let's see

614
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,459
if the moon cakes they made

615
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,340
are to our taste.

616
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,380
Slow down. Slow down.

617
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:29,860
Let's go.

618
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:30,900
Watch the steps.

619
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:32,299
Listen,

620
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,820
we're

621
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,140
all men.

622
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,459
You're

623
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:38,100
the famous lord of Tingqin Garden,

624
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,499
and you're

625
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,539
the venerable Lord of Valley Junior.

626
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:41,660
How could we

627
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:42,979
make moon cakes?

628
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,620
Don't you want to fight back?

629
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,180
How?

630
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,660
To fight against

631
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,019
the unfair treatment.

632
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,219
As for this,

633
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,459
I really want to talk to

634
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,100
our lord.

635
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:53,900
Me?

636
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,739
Zheng

637
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:56,820
Your reputation as the husband who spoils wife

638
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,180
has spread all over the society now.

639
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,699
When it comes to Tingqin Garden,

640
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,259
people would either talk about

641
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:03,060
the capable hostess,

642
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,019
or say

643
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:07,259
that the great Lord Qu Zheng

644
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,939
has now become a henpecked husband.

645
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:11,939
It's nothing

646
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:12,580
if it's only your business.

647
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,219
But do you know

648
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,539
how much pressure does it bring to us?

649
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,660
Right, Lord Qu.

650
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,539
And you should talk to your wife

651
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:20,539
to write fewer letters

652
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,380
to my Qiuer.

653
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:22,900
Every time your wife

654
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,900
wrote

655
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:24,739
to Qiuer,

656
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:26,380
she talked about

657
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,939
how happy you were.

658
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,739
So every time Qiuer finished reading,

659
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:31,420
she scolded me for not being romantic enough.

660
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,219
Yes,

661
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:33,100
you've improved

662
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:34,739
the standard on your own.

663
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,340
So in your opinion,

664
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:37,140
how should we

665
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,219
treat our wives?

666
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,259
Well...

667
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:41,180
Apparently,

668
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,699
we should be the decision-maker

669
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,140
on everything.

670
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,219
The women

671
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,620
should be obedient,

672
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:47,739
listen to us,

673
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:49,459
and do what we told them to do.

674
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:49,939
I...

675
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,180
Who should be obedient?

676
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:53,299
I, I...

677
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,699
Of course,

678
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,420
we should listen to our wives' orders.

679
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:57,499
Zhuozhuo, look.

680
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,539
How's the mooncake skin

681
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,100
I made?

682
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,499
That's not

683
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,299
what you said just now, Song Jianshan.

684
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:03,259
Zhuozhuo

685
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:05,219
There're so many people.

686
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:06,180
I'm sorry.

687
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,180
If I don't convince you,

688
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:09,340
you'll rebel someday.

689
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:09,979
Take this.

690
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:10,779
Zhuozhuo, Zhuozhuo, Zhuozhuo.

691
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,459
I'm sorry.

692
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:12,100
Stop.

693
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:12,860
Song Jianshan

694
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,499
Zhuozhuo

695
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:14,459
Stop!

696
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,860
I'm sorry.

697
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,779
Stop running!

698
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,060
Song Jianshan, are you looking for trouble?

699
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:20,860
What?

700
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:22,739
Do you think I'm not good enough?

701
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:23,979
Do you want to rebel with him?

702
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:24,459
Zhuozhuo

703
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:25,499
No, no, no,

704
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,660
no.

705
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,779
My dear Qiuer

706
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,580
Please.

707
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:30,060
Are you in charge of

708
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:31,499
all the affairs in Taoyuan Valley?

709
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:32,299
Or

710
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,820
who could write the novel

711
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:35,180
for all people in Taoyuan Valley,

712
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:35,699
right?

713
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,739
Ok, you're right.

714
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:39,060
Do you have anything

715
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,019
to say?

716
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,180
I'm really sorry.

717
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:43,100
Now people all said

718
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,140
that the Lord of Tingqin Garden is afraid of his wife.

719
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,420
They may call me a tigress.

720
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,580
Of course you're not.

721
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,019
But,

722
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:52,699
the thing that

723
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:53,660
the Lord of Tingqin Garden is afraid of his wife

724
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,699
wins a good reputation for me.

725
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:56,340
Am I right?

726
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,660
See if you can catch me.

727
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,060
Stop, you!

728
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:04,420
-Come on. -Stop.

729
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:05,660
I'm exhausted.

730
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,299
Listen to me.

731
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,620
So sweet.

732
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,380
Could you please stop?

733
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,259
You can't catch me.

734
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:10,499
This is what I always want.

735
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:12,180
To live a peaceful life

736
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,580
with you forever.

737
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,939
Baiwan

738
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:17,739
This is also

739
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,660
what I want.

740
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,939
To live a happy life with you till the end of time.

741
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,100
Cunning fox

742
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:24,299
Then we'll

743
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,979
live a peaceful and happy life forever.

744
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,219
Nothing can separate us.

745
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,779
Ok.

746
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:30,900
Live a peaceful and happy life forever.

747
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:32,739
Nothing can separate us.

748
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,699
Under the witness of the sky,

749
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,900
I'm marrying

750
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,499
Miss Baiwan

751
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:48,739
today.

752
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,259
I swear

753
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:52,380
that Baiwan is

754
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,779
my only love for my entire life.

755
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:16,299
From now on,

756
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:17,900
I won't

757
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:22,900
meet Miss Jin again.

758
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,019
Shu

759
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:20,180
Song Jianshan

760
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:20,739
Zhuozhuo

761
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,580
Stop!

762
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,340
-Stop! -Zhuozhuo

763
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,380
Watch out!

764
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,660
What?

765
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,019
You just don't want to be pricked.
