00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

10002
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:40,278
Fall in Love with a Fox EP06

3
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,900
She'll like it.

4
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,820
How much is it?

5
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,260
Mandarin duck jade concentric.

6
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,299
18 taels.

7
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
18 taels.

8
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,340
OK, I'll take it.

9
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:51,779
OK.

10
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,219
You can look around

11
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,460
and see if there is something else you like.

12
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,379
No need.

13
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,859
OK.

14
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:01,980
Since you like the hair clasp,

15
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,859
why don't you have a try?

16
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,579
You've got a good taste.

17
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,500
The hair clasp

18
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,740
and the jade,

19
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:12,380
all together, I'll charge you 32 taels.

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,899
32 taels.

21
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,100
But I have only 26 taels.

22
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,339
I'll take only this one.

23
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,060
Pack it for me, please.

24
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:21,500
Thank you.

25
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,140
Since you like both,

26
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
why not taking both?

27
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:24,859
OK.

28
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,500
I'll pack this one first.

29
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:27,859
No, no need,

30
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,740
Mr Qu

31
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,339
The reason why I'm doing the escort job

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,460
is to make money

33
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,820
for my Miss's wedding gift.

34
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:34,939
I have to buy it myself.

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,979
Besides, the engagement between us

36
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,579
is interest exchange.

37
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,780
I can't spend your money.

38
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:43,699
Sorry, I was just too impulsive

39
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:45,300
to take full consideration.

40
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,940
But this peach blossom hair clasp,

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,059
please take it.

42
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,779
I know

43
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,100
you've got a lot of misunderstandings about me

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,460
all the way.

45
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,979
But since we're

46
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,180
engaged,

47
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,180
I hope you'll take

48
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,499
this engagement gift.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,699
It's not only a gift.

50
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,180
Hope you can treat it

51
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,660
as

52
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:25,740
what you do to your fox hang drop.

53
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,259
Cherish it.

54
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,619
Where's Song Jianshan?

55
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:45,860
He should be somewhere

56
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,659
eating snacks.

57
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,339
You don't need to worry about him.

58
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,300
You gave me a gift today,

59
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:53,379
but I never got you a gift.

60
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,499
I'll buy you a gift someday.

61
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,180
So how about

62
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,819
giving it to me?

63
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,339
Fortune-telling.

64
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:02,779
No, no, no,

65
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,420
we are not charlatans.

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,499
It's a lucky marriage draw.

67
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:10,059
Try and take it home as a souvenir.

68
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:12,499
Five pence each draw.

69
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,980
Do you want it

70
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,219
because it's cheap?

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,499
No, I want

72
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:18,899
the luck.

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,700
Well,

74
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,659
OK.

75
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:22,740
Let's do it.

76
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:24,939
OK.

77
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,460
Sir,

78
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,499
what's the rule?

79
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,219
Reach into the box,

80
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,379
and grab a sign,

81
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,700
then it's your

82
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,059
marriage draw.

83
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,219
OK, let me have a look.

84
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,260
The love of a lifetime is unforgettable.

85
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,860
It's not an ordinary man.

86
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:02,420
I don't know where the fireflies are.

87
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,899
A girl wearing a clasp is my lifelong lover.

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,499
Oh, it's exactly you.

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,899
You're wearing

90
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,300
the peach blossom hair clasp.

91
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:16,379
Where the fireflies are?

92
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:18,899
Fireflies?

93
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,499
I like fireflies the best.

94
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:23,499
I see.

95
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:41,619
What's the song?

96
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:43,779
How come I've never heard it?

97
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,700
I wrote it for you.

98
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,059
I've got a name, too.

99
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,260
To the End of Time.

100
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,420
With whom?

101
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,420
Well,

102
00:05:59,139 --> 00:05:59,699
how about this?

103
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,579
I didn't expect that music

104
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,660
can do this.

105
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:20,740
More than that.

106
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,139
I can't believe the draw is right.

107
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Amazing.

108
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,819
According to the notes,

109
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,619
you two

110
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,499
will live a happy life

111
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,699
forever.

112
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,660
Please keep the draw properly.

113
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,660
Here you are.

114
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,579
Is it what you want?

115
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,900
It's my first gift

116
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,980
from you.

117
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,900
I'll treasure it with care.

118
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:31,660
Just tell me the truth.

119
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,699
Master, your body is recovering,

120
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,499
but

121
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,939
if without Saussurea involucrata,

122
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,819
I'm afraid your power

123
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,379
will decline greatly.

124
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:45,860
Young Master

125
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,059
Master said

126
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,740
that during his lockdown period,

127
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,900
he would meet no one.

128
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,699
I just want to

129
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,340
bring some helpful medicine for dad.

130
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,420
I've said a lot of times.

131
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,499
I would not meet anyone.

132
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,499
Dad

133
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:59,139
I heard you were injured,

134
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,100
so I want...

135
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,900
Shut up.

136
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,699
This is the Nonuple Palace.

137
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:04,300
There's only the master.

138
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,180
OK, Master.

139
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,660
Retreat.

140
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,699
Your Majesty

141
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,660
I've heard about

142
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,459
the Saussurea involucrata.

143
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,379
Tell me.

144
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:29,300
It's in the warehouse of Taoyuan Valley now.

145
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,259
Warehouse of Taoyuan Valley.

146
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:31,499
But it's strongly built

147
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:32,499
and well guarded,

148
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,180
only when Yu Linfeng

149
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,900
gets married,

150
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,100
will it be taken out

151
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,180
as the wedding gift to Jin's Escort Agency.

152
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,379
So we have to

153
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:41,139
wait another half a month.

154
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:42,619
After half a month,

155
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,100
if you can't get the Saussurea involucrata,

156
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,459
you'll be toasted.

157
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:50,579
Yes.

158
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Mater is in his lockdown period.

159
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,579
Nonuple Token is the symbol of the master.

160
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Knelt down to listen to the order.

161
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,499
OK.

162
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,540
Master's order:

163
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,220
Envoy Xueyue will take the place of the Young Master

164
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,540
to head to Taoyuan Valley for the wedding.

165
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,420
That's it.

166
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,259
I'll follow the order.

167
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,139
Stop.

168
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
During master's lockdown,

169
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,220
he didn't want to see me.

170
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:17,579
But he only met you,

171
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:18,579
Envoy Xueyue.

172
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,499
Tell me.

173
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,379
What are you hiding from me?

174
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,660
Master didn't hide anything

175
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:23,340
from you.

176
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,980
He just thought

177
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,379
that during his lockdown,

178
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,259
you need to

179
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,459
be in charge of the palace,

180
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:29,499
so...

181
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:30,660
You're the leader of Heisha,

182
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,619
will Master assign you to

183
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,819
this meaningless task?

184
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:35,459
You're over-concerned.

185
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,139
Master

186
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,180
has his own reasons.

187
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,379
If you stop seeking for

188
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:41,660
someone,

189
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,180
Master will continue to value you.

190
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,980
I told you I didn't want

191
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,499
to hear anything about Chu from you,

192
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,579
or I won't be nice to you.

193
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,499
Young Master

194
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:09,540
I've checked

195
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:10,699
that Envoy Xueyue

196
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,699
did head to

197
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:12,459
the direction of Taoyuan Valley.

198
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,660
And there are no other weird things.

199
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,380
It's weird.

200
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:19,699
Why?

201
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:21,459
Dad

202
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,660
only assigns her

203
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,939
to

204
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:24,939
murder someone.

205
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,260
Dad has stayed secluded for so long,

206
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,859
and his only order was assigning

207
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,939
her to Taoyuan Valley.

208
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,099
So

209
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,380
the thing that Envoy Xueyue

210
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,620
heads to Taoyuan Valley to attend the wedding

211
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:36,979
might just be an excuse.

212
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,620
She may have other purposes.

213
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,459
I feel that she is

214
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:42,059
hiding something from me,

215
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,339
and she always talks about Chu.

216
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,059
So how about the next thing to do?

217
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,500
Check it out.

218
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,339
Yes.

219
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,219
What's your name?

220
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:01,180
I...

221
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,099
I'm Qingyun.

222
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:04,099
I'm Chu.

223
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,059
Thank you, Chu.

224
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,219
If they

225
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:16,420
bully you again,

226
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,780
you have to resist.

227
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:18,660
Got it?

228
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,780
But I can't see.

229
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,780
So what?

230
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,500
As long as we practice more,

231
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,859
we don't need to be afraid of them.

232
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:28,699
Come on,

233
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:29,979
let's go practicing.

234
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:07,739
Qingyun

235
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,140
Any good news?

236
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,380
Dad said that he knew a famous doctor

237
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
and he could cure my eyes.

238
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:12,500
Really?

239
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:13,540
Great!

240
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,219
I'll be able to

241
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,180
see you very soon.

242
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,739
You won't just be able to see me.

243
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,939
I'll take you to see

244
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:19,979
the best view

245
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,339
and do what you want.

246
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,900
But

247
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,780
I got a new task.

248
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:25,859
Well, I'll wait for you.

249
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,059
I want to see you first.

250
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,180
I'll pass Baiyun Town.

251
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:30,939
There's your

252
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,819
favorite Baiyu pastry.

253
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:32,900
I'll bring it for you.

254
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:33,939
OK.

255
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,180
Chu

256
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,620
No matter where you are,

257
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,219
I'll definitely find you.

258
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:43,780
We're here.

259
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,300
Where is it?

260
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:46,459
Go down and have a look.

261
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,939
It's in the middle of nowhere.

262
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,900
There's nothing to look around.

263
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,339
Did you forget

264
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,500
what you said?

265
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,420
What I said?

266
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,979
What are you doing?

267
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,420
It doesn't matter if you don't remember.

268
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:15,660
But I do.

269
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,339
So many fireflies.

270
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,420
I don't know where the fireflies are.

271
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,660
A girl wearing a clasp is my lifelong lover.

272
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,699
Did you say that

273
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,579
you liked fireflies the best?

274
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,500
You...

275
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,699
Did you bring me here specially?

276
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,979
There's the best view.

277
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:54,500
This time

278
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,339
I did not only see how difficult the martial arts world was,

279
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,579
and how terrible people were.

280
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,180
I didn't expect

281
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,099
to see such a beautiful view.

282
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,780
You forgot one thing.

283
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,500
What?

284
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
You got to know me.

285
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,300
But this time

286
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,819
I do need to thank you.

287
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,540
I've written so much

288
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:19,540
nonsense

289
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,699
on the bulletin.

290
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,939
What if

291
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,620
they all believed what I wrote?

292
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,859
During this escort,

293
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:27,260
you should see

294
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:28,900
there are so many

295
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,140
profit-oriented

296
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,500
and weak-will people in this world.

297
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,859
So I don't care about

298
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:34,380
what they think.

299
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,300
If you need

300
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,780
any help,

301
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:38,660
just tell me.

302
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,620
Don't feel pressured.

303
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:40,939
By the way,

304
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,739
I have one more thing.

305
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,579
What's it?

306
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:46,459
Since we're engaged,

307
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,180
it's improper

308
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:48,859
for us to call each other like this.

309
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,660
How about

310
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,219
I call you Baiwan.

311
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,859
What should I call you?

312
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,739
The same as Song Jianshan.

313
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:01,219
Call me Zheng.

314
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,900
Zheng

315
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,579
What? I can't hear you.

316
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:11,459
Zheng

317
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:13,620
What?

318
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,579
You're making fun of me.

319
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:25,540
If Baiwan

320
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:26,939
can't say these two words

321
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,180
clearly,

322
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,859
I'm afraid we're gonna spend the night

323
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,300
in the carriage.

324
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:39,979
Zheng

325
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,780
Yes.

326
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,459
Why did I fall asleep again?

327
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,979
Give the monkey exactly what one wants.

328
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:18,780
Give the monkey exactly what one wants.

329
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,660
I have to finish these books quickly.

330
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:21,540
Or I won't know

331
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,459
how to chat with him.

332
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:23,739
And this music score.

333
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:25,180
What if

334
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:26,140
he wants to play with me again?

335
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:28,900
Miss Muqiu

336
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:31,620
Mr Yu

337
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,180
What's wrong?

338
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,739
I thought that

339
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:35,819
you must feel bored

340
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:36,620
all the way,

341
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,500
so I'm here to chat with you.

342
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,500
Again?

343
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,739
I have nothing to chat.

344
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:46,900
So how about talking about

345
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:49,339
Xie Lingyun?

346
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:50,699
Miss Muqiu

347
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:51,660
Do you like Lord Kangle too?

348
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,180
Among his poetical works,

349
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:55,739
I like it the best.

350
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,180
Land on the isolated island in rivers.

351
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,500
Go through the regions south of the Yangtze River.

352
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,739
Look around the regions north of the Yangtze River.

353
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,339
Where's it? Where?

354
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,819
OK, here.

355
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,500
Turn to the Huaixin Road.

356
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,780
Looking for difference, and the scenery.

357
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,859
I didn't expect you

358
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:17,260
know this poem.

359
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,219
That Go Upstairs

360
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,699
is also one of my favorite.

361
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,579
A man's life is long.

362
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,500
It's hard to leave the crowd.

363
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,579
Practice is not unique to the past.

364
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,300
There is no stuffy sign in today.

365
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,540
Miss Muqiu

366
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,380
You really share the same interest with me.

367
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,300
Miss Muqiu

368
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,300
You're really my bosom friend.

369
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,420
Oh, this is the Taoyuan Town.

370
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
Peach flower cake.

371
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,699
Crispy and sweet.

372
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:57,699
Stop.

373
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,420
Slow down, slow down.

374
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,900
It's enough.

375
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:02,339
OK, OK.

376
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,979
It's enough.

377
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,859
Here, here.

378
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:04,660
Money.

379
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,979
Mine, mine, mine.

380
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,140
I touched it first.

381
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,500
You can't grab it from me. I...

382
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,219
It's you.

383
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:10,660
You know me?

384
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:11,739
Yes,

385
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,939
I, the great doctor Su Zhuozhuo, am famous.

386
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,579
It's normal to have a few admirers.

387
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,099
Sir

388
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,579
Since you know me,

389
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,260
please give this

390
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,380
to me.

391
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,420
Yes, I know you,

392
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:25,300
but

393
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:26,219
when it comes to food,

394
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,939
I won't give it

395
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:29,140
to anyone.

396
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,579
OK,

397
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,180
let's see

398
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,699
who can get it.

399
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:35,819
I...

400
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,060
I don't hurt women.

401
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,340
Let it go.

402
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:46,580
I...

403
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,180
What a coincidence.

404
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,100
My mom said

405
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,660
that if you don't beat men, they'll be rebellious.

406
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,180
I...

407
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,620
Thank you.

408
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:00,459
It's not my plan.

409
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,620
Su Zhuozhuo

410
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
You poisoned in the needle again.

411
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,060
Well, you know my skill.

412
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,340
Keep it in mind.

413
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,299
Peach flower cake.

414
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:16,699
What's wrong?

415
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:20,860
You...

416
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:22,340
You two...

417
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:24,499
You...

418
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:27,660
Why do you two stay together again?

419
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:35,299
Engaged?

420
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,739
You?

421
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,660
And Mr Qu?

422
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,660
Yes, right.

423
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:42,180
Impossible.

424
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,739
You've only known each other for a few days.

425
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:44,779
Feelings

426
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:46,140
can't be measured by time.

427
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,699
You

428
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,539
just pretended to be engaged for investigation,

429
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:55,060
right?

430
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:00,620
All the way here,

431
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,979
I've fallen in love with

432
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:02,860
Miss Baiwan.

433
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,100
I believe you feel the same thing

434
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,299
for me.

435
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,299
So our engagement

436
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:08,779
is natural,

437
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:09,499
right?

438
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:12,259
Yes,

439
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,499
we're really in love

440
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:20,100
till the end of our life.

441
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:20,939
Jin Baiwan

442
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,259
Did you forget

443
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,900
that he hung you on a tree,

444
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:24,979
and he ordered someone

445
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,100
to throw you out of the courier station.

446
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:27,939
We began our journey the same time.

447
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,340
Why did he only fall in love with you?

448
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,219
I... I have no idea.

449
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:39,180
What?

450
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,219
Mr Qu

451
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:50,939
If I stay,

452
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,219
would it

453
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,219
be different?

454
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,779
Maybe you...

455
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:57,299
Maybe Miss Baiwan and I

456
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,739
fell in love with each other in our previous life.

457
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,219
What are you doing in Taoyuan Valley?

458
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,660
Same with you.

459
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,499
We're here to say congratulations.

460
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:06,299
Of course,

461
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,420
beside this,

462
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,340
we're here

463
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,900
to propose officially in front of Mr Jin.

464
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:14,140
You're really getting married?

465
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,620
Yes.

466
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:18,860
Miss Su, please rest assured.

467
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,699
Tingqin Garden

468
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,140
will definitely send you an invitation card by that time.

469
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:22,820
After all,

470
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,100
you are the witness of love

471
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:25,299
between our lord

472
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,660
and Miss Baiwan.

473
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,900
When their baby celebrates its first month birthday,

474
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,219
we'll also invite you.

475
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,820
Shut up.

476
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:39,539
Leave the peach flower cake here.

477
00:21:59,580 --> 00:21:59,900
You...

478
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:02,380
What are you doing here?

479
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,340
Listen,

480
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:04,860
what between Mr Qu and Jin Baiwan

481
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:06,779
is weird to me.

482
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:08,699
They won't tell me if I ask.

483
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,620
But you,

484
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,180
you're the dark guard of Mr Qu,

485
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,219
and you followed us all the way.

486
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,699
You must know the truth, right?

487
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:16,979
Yes,

488
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,219
I know,

489
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,499
but

490
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,580
don't you think

491
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,660
it's not a proper time

492
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,939
to talk?

493
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,939
I'm a doctor.

494
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,140
I've seen

495
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,580
all kinds of bodies.

496
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:29,620
I...

497
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:30,699
Song Jianshan

498
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,340
What are you doing?

499
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,219
I'm a doctor.

500
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,620
I've seen everything.

501
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,259
Would you dare to

502
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,979
talk to me in clothes?

503
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,660
I won't.

504
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,699
How about you take off your clothes?

505
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,580
Put your clothes on.

506
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,580
No, I won't.

507
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:46,380
Open your eyes, and fight with me.

508
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:46,900
Do you believe

509
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,860
I'll kill you later?

510
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,620
No!

511
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:49,499
Open your eyes.

512
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:50,259
You...

513
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,939
You want to run away?

514
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,620
Don't come over.

515
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:00,900
Or I'll open the curtains.

516
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,660
OK, do it.

517
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,979
Do you think you can run away

518
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,380
in such a close distance?

519
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,499
You...

520
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,420
Su Zhuozhuo

521
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,459
You poisoned me again.

522
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:12,219
Tell me,

523
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:13,939
is what happened between them true?

524
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,459
It doesn't matter.

525
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,620
Mr Qu doesn't like you,

526
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:17,299
which is true.

527
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:18,100
OK,

528
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,820
it's fake for sure.

529
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,699
I...

530
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,140
Give me the antidote.

531
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:22,900
You tell me first.

532
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,459
I do hurt women.

533
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,459
OK, let's see whether

534
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,739
could you do it?

535
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:27,860
I...

536
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,259
You mean it?

537
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:30,299
Ha-ha, you're still young.

538
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,739
Miss will come tomorrow.

539
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:43,499
How should I tell her

540
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:45,060
what happened between me and Zheng?

541
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:47,539
Zheng?

542
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:49,580
How dare you

543
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:50,459
call Mr Qu so intimately.

544
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,499
How should I call Mr Qu...

545
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,860
How should I call my husband

546
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,900
has nothing to do with you.

547
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,820
Husband?

548
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:04,979
Ridiculous.

549
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,620
Didn't you hear that

550
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,499
Mr Qu and I have fallen in love

551
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,939
and we've engaged long ago?

552
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:14,739
Engaged, hum?

553
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:15,979
Well,

554
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:17,939
you're trying to kill him with the engagement.

555
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,299
How's it possible?

556
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,100
He's my husband.

557
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,420
How could I hurt him?

558
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,900
Stop pretending.

559
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:24,739
Jin Baiwan, I knew

560
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,060
your engagement

561
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:27,180
is fake.

562
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,340
That's between me and Mr Qu.

563
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:34,140
None of your business.

564
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,620
It's related to Mr Qu.

565
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,660
It's my business.

566
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:38,499
He's kind and upright.

567
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,739
He cured you and helped you to escort.

568
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:41,620
What did you do?

569
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,180
You used him.

570
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,219
All people

571
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,299
are looking for you,

572
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:46,860
and you're using him as the shield.

573
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,060
You're not trying to hurt him,

574
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:48,699
aren't you?

575
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,660
I am not.

576
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,779
Still trying to justify, right?

577
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,180
I thought

578
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,060
you were just uneducated,

579
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,180
but I didn't expect you

580
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:56,340
to be so mean.

581
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,100
That's a pretty good one, isn't it?

582
00:24:58,259 --> 00:24:58,820
I...

583
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,900
Do you think that

584
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:01,779
Mr Qu engaged with you

585
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:03,499
because he liked you?

586
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,900
Listen,

587
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,620
he did it because you were hurt

588
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,660
and he felt sorry for you.

589
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,860
In my view,

590
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,820
the cut

591
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,820
must be set by you in advance.

592
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,420
I...

593
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:12,979
What?

594
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:14,180
Speak.

595
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:15,620
Nothing to say?

596
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,340
If I were you,

597
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:20,779
I'd feel ashamed to be here with Mr Qu.

598
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:21,900
I'd leave myself long ago.

599
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,660
That's great.

600
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:30,660
She's right.

601
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,140
I am a drag on Zheng.

602
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:35,779
I can't be so selfish.

603
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,820
How's it?

604
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,180
I've checked it out clearly.

605
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,699
Envoy Xueyue and Feilian

606
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,219
are heading to the direction of Taoyuan Valley.

607
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,979
But they've had no actions so far.

608
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,699
It seems that they're to attend the wedding.

609
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,100
So

610
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,100
their target

611
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,420
is in Taoyuan Valley.

612
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:03,340
OK, I'm

613
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:04,299
going to there to investigate.

614
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:04,860
Stop.

615
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,499
You're staying outside the valley.

616
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,340
This time

617
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:12,660
I have to see myself

618
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,939
what she wants to do.

619
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:14,900
Yes.

620
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:17,420
Baiwan

621
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,380
Ready to go to Taoyuan Valley.

622
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:23,620
Baiwan?

623
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:40,739
As for matters related to Jin's Escort Agency,

624
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,299
you don't need to worry about it.

625
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:43,420
I'll think about a way myself

626
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:44,380
to enter Taoyuan Valley.

627
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:48,499
Where's Miss Baiwan?

628
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,340
She wants to

629
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:51,259
go to Taoyuan Valley herself.

630
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,140
Go find her.

631
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,459
Flowers.

632
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,380
No,

633
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,459
if I go in and get recognized,

634
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:02,499
it'll bring troubles for Miss.

635
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,499
What to do?

636
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,779
Miss

637
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,499
I have no way but to bother you.

638
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:24,939
Don't blame me.

639
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:33,979
Welcome,

640
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,860
Lord Qu of Tingqin Garden.

641
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:38,860
Congratulations on

642
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,259
the wedding between Taoyuan Valley and Jin's Escort Agency.

643
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:41,939
Are the people from

644
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,499
Jin's Escort Agency here?

645
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,180
It took a while to get back to the valley.

646
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:45,660
Young Master

647
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,259
Lord

648
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,380
and the Miss of Jin's Escort Agency

649
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,860
will go back two days after.

650
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,539
Before that, Lord

651
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:51,900
and other guests

652
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,979
please have fun in the valley.

653
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:56,100
We'll provide you the best services.

654
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,459
Please.

655
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,140
Welcome

656
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,060
guests from Nonuple Palace.

657
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,979
Your quarters are ready.

658
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,100
They are over there.

659
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,140
Follow me please.

660
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,340
Please.

661
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:09,140
Envoy Xueyue

662
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:10,459
Is this the Qu Zheng

663
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:11,219
making troubles in Yinxue Village?

664
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,380
Where's it?

665
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,580
Sorry.

666
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:15,979
You two

667
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,820
are from Nonuple Palace, right?

668
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Welcome, welcome.

669
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:19,900
Yes, we are.

670
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:21,779
Our Master is in his lockdown period.

671
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,060
So he assigned me and my junior sister apprentice

672
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:24,380
to say congratulations to Young Master of the valley.

673
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,580
Thank you.

674
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,100
I've heard that Tingqin Lord

675
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:32,180
is very manly.

676
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:33,380
The moment I saw you

677
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,739
I knew it's true.

678
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,140
I'm the first disciple of Nonuple Palace,

679
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,900
Zijing.

680
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,060
Oh, you're Heroine Zijing

681
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,699
from Nonuple Palace.

682
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:43,060
Nice to meet you.

683
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:57,180
Puyuan Canon

684
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,900
disturbed the martial arts world.

685
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,420
I heard it's you

686
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,939
who settled this down in Yinxue Village.

687
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,660
I'm here

688
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,699
to say congratulations.

689
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:05,900
What happened in the martial arts world

690
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:07,340
should be left aside

691
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,380
this happy place.

692
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,259
You've traveled a long way.

693
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:12,739
Why not following me

694
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:13,499
to your residence for rest?

695
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,060
Please, please.

696
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,340
Although you're hired temporarily

697
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,420
to help,

698
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,299
but there are rules

699
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:24,420
in Taoyuan Valley.

700
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,180
If you don't follow them,

701
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,979
I won't be nice.

702
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,820
Miss will arrive at the valley

703
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,979
two days later.

704
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
What should I do?

705
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,060
Do I

706
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:36,580
have no other ways but follow him to the kitchen?

707
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:42,019
Steward Wang

708
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,900
There's one more person

709
00:29:42,939 --> 00:29:43,620
who needs to go to the kitchen.

710
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,380
Take him with you.

711
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,380
Yes.

712
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:47,299
Come here.

713
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:49,380
I have to warn you.

714
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,259
Behave yourself.

715
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,739
Don't say what you shouldn't say.

716
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,299
Don't look at what you shouldn't look.
