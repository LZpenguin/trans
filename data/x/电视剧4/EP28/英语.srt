00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:40,167
Fall in Love with a Fox EP28

3
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,140
I'm Yu Linfeng from Taoyuan Valley.

4
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,779
Today I'm here to cancel my Martial Arts Bet

5
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,820
with Jin Muqiu of Jin's Escort Agency.

6
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,939
So I'm going to issue my challenge to

7
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:51,219
the top five Grandmasters of Alliance of Martial Arts.

8
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,500
Please enlighten me, my dear seniors.

9
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,019
Feng, go back to Taoyuan Valley with me.

10
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,859
If you signed the life and death contract,

11
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,019
you might die!

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,859
My lady

13
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,300
The battle drum is beating.

14
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:01,539
A man of Taoyuan Valley

15
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,460
would never get cold feet.

16
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,780
I don't care!

17
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,219
I want my son alive

18
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:07,180
even if that means being laughed by the world

19
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,980
and being punished by you.

20
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,859
Feng

21
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,219
Forgive me, mother.

22
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,180
I can't step back.

23
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:15,460
Good.

24
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:16,939
So I'm all my ears

25
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,020
to your reason.

26
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,299
Father

27
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,579
From childhood, you've been teaching me how to behave properly,

28
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,299
how to avoid loose ends,

29
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:34,899
and how to be a qualified

30
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Young Master of Taoyuan Valley.

31
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,219
And I did them all.

32
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,899
These years,

33
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,539
I always know

34
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,180
how to properly behave myself

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,539
and how to

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,300
conduct myself.

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,339
But I was not happy

38
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,499
until I met Qiuer.

39
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:56,100
I have spent my

40
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,899
happiest hours

41
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,100
with Qiuer.

42
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,300
It's also Qiuer who

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,419
showed me that

44
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,539
I can also make heart decisions

45
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,259
and seek my dreams.

46
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,300
She might not be

47
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,220
perfect to be

48
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,339
the Young Mrs of Taoyuan Valley.

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,580
But she's my love.

50
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:16,460
Since I know

51
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,779
who she is,

52
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:18,940
I have made up my mind

53
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,180
to be with her forever.

54
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,100
Brother Shu

55
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:32,979
Miss Jin

56
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,499
Do you know where Zhuo

57
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
is right now?

58
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,300
You must be Zhuo's father.

59
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,339
Keep it down.

60
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:41,860
Or people would find out

61
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,259
you're here too.

62
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,139
Thank you, Uncle Su.

63
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:46,939
Because of her,

64
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,300
you're not only risking

65
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
your life,

66
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,180
but trying to lose the reputation of Taoyuan Valley.

67
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:52,059
Father

68
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,659
Mother

69
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,899
I know

70
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,420
nothing can be accomplished

71
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,099
without norms and standards.

72
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,460
And I'm not defying

73
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,540
any norms or standards.

74
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,339
I just want to

75
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,460
prove that

76
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:04,619
Qiuer is not the one

77
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,300
who let me break rules,

78
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,219
but the one

79
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
who let me know how

80
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:11,219
to honor

81
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,740
the promises I made.

82
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,300
So this battle

83
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,499
is not only for Qiuer,

84
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,260
but for myself as well.

85
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,300
Brother Shu

86
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:23,980
You can do it.

87
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,580
Nice words.

88
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,180
Well,

89
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:31,260
I understand.

90
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:34,140
Okay, bring it on.

91
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,779
Let me see how

92
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,180
determined you are.

93
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,819
Great.

94
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,059
Round One

95
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,180
Yu Linfeng of Taoyuan Valley

96
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,980
vs Yu Fei, the Lord of Taoyuan Valley.

97
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,540
Please forgive my rudeness, father.

98
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,379
Father

99
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,700
Son

100
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:07,939
I thought you were

101
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:09,499
merely wrong-headed,

102
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,460
but it turned out that

103
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,260
you've thought it through.

104
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,059
Since you've known

105
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,540
what you're doing,

106
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,180
I promise you,

107
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,779
from now on,

108
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,260
I won't stop you from

109
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:23,659
having a new start

110
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:26,700
with Miss Jin.

111
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,659
You mean...

112
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,099
I give in.

113
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,580
Give in?

114
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,939
Brother Jin

115
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,300
There's no such rules that

116
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,140
giving in is not allowed, right?

117
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,460
You...

118
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:39,379
Okay.

119
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,540
For the first round,

120
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:43,260
Yu Linfeng of Taoyuan Valley wins.

121
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,540
Thank you, father.

122
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,740
Round Two

123
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,619
Lord of Valley of Taoyuan Valley

124
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,019
vs the Lord of Fengyun Manor.

125
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,819
Since Lord Yu has given in,

126
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,579
I'll let that kid go.

127
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:03,579
Thanks a lot.

128
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,939
In that case,

129
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:06,579
I'll pull out of the game too.

130
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,819
Thank you.

131
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,420
He's devoted to her!

132
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,220
How could we old guys

133
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,019
break up such an

134
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,420
affectionate couple?

135
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,340
I'm also throwing in the towel.

136
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,980
Thanks a lot.

137
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,579
Many thanks for your kindness, my seniors.

138
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,059
I really appreciate it.

139
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,420
That's great!

140
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,379
So you're here, Qiuer.

141
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,819
Brother Shu, I knew

142
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,100
you can cancel the Martial Arts Bet.

143
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,619
You brat

144
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,300
They have thrown the game for you.

145
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,499
But I won't let you off easily.

146
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:54,900
You think it's done?

147
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:57,740
Father

148
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,139
Yu Linfeng

149
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,619
You've broken my daughter's heart.

150
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,900
Don't ever expect any mercy from me.

151
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,300
I dare not.

152
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,420
Father-in-law...

153
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,180
Hope to learn some skills from Head Escort Jin.

154
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,340
Round Five

155
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,139
Yu Linfeng of Taoyuan Valley

156
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,139
vs the Head Escort of Jin's Escort Agency,

157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,660
Jin Gunan.

158
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,059
My father can't be serious,

159
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,980
can he?

160
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,340
Take it, you brat.

161
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:37,259
Yes, sir.

162
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,980
I dare not to disobey.

163
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,699
The first punch

164
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,699
is for Qiuer.

165
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,939
As she has come all the way to Taoyuan Valley

166
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,980
to marry you.

167
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,699
She has sacrificed a lot for you.

168
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,340
But you just don't know how to cherish.

169
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:55,740
It's all my fault.

170
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,379
From now on,

171
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,019
I will

172
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,220
be devoted to Qiuer,

173
00:07:59,459 --> 00:07:59,980
and never put her

174
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:00,819
through any trouble.

175
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,900
Okay.

176
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:03,379
The second punch is

177
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,819
also for Qiuer.

178
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,019
For all she has suffered from

179
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,059
the bad relation with her mother-in-law.

180
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,819
It's men's responsibility to reconcile them.

181
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,259
Do you understand?

182
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,619
My father's serious.

183
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:31,019
It's all my fault.

184
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,619
I promise

185
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,059
from this day on,

186
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,220
no disputes would exist

187
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,059
between Qiuer and my mother.

188
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,420
The third one

189
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:43,819
is for the novels.

190
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,499
For her novels

191
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:48,699
burnt by you.

192
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,660
You know what is Qiuer's

193
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,579
favorite hobby?

194
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:53,819
Writing novels.

195
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:55,340
As a man,

196
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,180
you should leave her

197
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,139
do whatever she likes.

198
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,379
You hear me?

199
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,019
It's all my fault.

200
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,740
I was as blind as a bat.

201
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:03,780
Qiuer's novels

202
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,300
are well-loved by people,

203
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,059
and refused to get into a rut.

204
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,699
From now on,

205
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:07,780
I will support her with my heart and soul

206
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,100
and be the number-one fan of her.

207
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,059
There's no place in his heart for his mother.

208
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,379
Look at him.

209
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:14,900
Calm down, my lady.

210
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:15,699
Calm down.

211
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:16,619
All right.

212
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,139
I'll kick your ass for your blindness.

213
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,019
Father

214
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,619
You said you know how far to go.

215
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
I know when to stop.

216
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:29,699
I...

217
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,100
Father

218
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,180
Busy now.

219
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,220
Father

220
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,059
Stop it.

221
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,059
I...

222
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,100
Father, stop

223
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,459
finding fault with Brother Shu.

224
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:42,540
I was being willful,

225
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,059
and insincere.

226
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,139
And I have failed to

227
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,699
have a good communication with his mother.

228
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:02,379
But it is true love

229
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,740
between Brother Shu and me.

230
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,019
And we really want to cancel the bet.

231
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,100
You...

232
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:14,459
Father

233
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:15,020
What...

234
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,620
If you

235
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,819
hurt Brother Shu for real,

236
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:17,699
you won't see

237
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:18,380
your daughter any more.

238
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,420
No, no.

239
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,380
Father

240
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:22,380
Are you sure about this?

241
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,300
From now on,

242
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,699
can you make sure your family

243
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,660
will always be harmonious and happy?

244
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:27,500
Yes.

245
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:28,819
What if

246
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,739
something goes wrong?

247
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:31,979
-Of course it's my fault. -Of course it's my fault.

248
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,660
Never break up peacefully again?

249
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:34,979
Never again.

250
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,420
Why are you looking at me?

251
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:40,339
Qiuer

252
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,780
You are my lovely

253
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:42,579
daughter.

254
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:43,660
Of course I'll give you

255
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,459
whatever you want.

256
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:48,020
Is that right, guys?

257
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,939
Lord Yu

258
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,339
I give in.

259
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,099
Head Escort Jin

260
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,660
You really mean it?

261
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:56,900
Of course.

262
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,260
But...

263
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:00,660
Qiuer

264
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,620
You really know nothing about disciplining your husband.

265
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:05,540
You...

266
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:07,420
The proverb is true, "a grown girl can't be kept at home".

267
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:09,140
I give in.

268
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:11,900
Everyone,

269
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,819
Yu Linfeng of Taoyuan Valley

270
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,699
has won the five Grandmasters of Alliance of Martial Arts.

271
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,540
Now please allow me to represent Battle of martial arts by the lake

272
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:20,059
to announce the Martial Arts Bet

273
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:21,939
made by Yu Linfeng and Jin Muqiu

274
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:28,979
is canceled officially.

275
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,459
Awesome.

276
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:33,739
That's great.

277
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,380
Didn't Mrs. Yu mention

278
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,219
where she was going?

279
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:20,900
Mrs. Yu just said that

280
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,099
she wanted to wander around the town.

281
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:22,739
We have no idea why she

282
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,180
came back so late.

283
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,219
I'm back.

284
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:28,620
Go out.

285
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,859
Yes, Lord Yu.

286
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm not drunk.

287
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:39,620
Where did you go?

288
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:40,660
You smell like alcohol.

289
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:41,979
Me?

290
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,699
Of course I was in the world of wine and men.

291
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,300
The world of wine and men?

292
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,939
Having a drink, you know,

293
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,459
certainly I'll

294
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:55,859
have men around me.

295
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:58,059
You mean you went

296
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,099
drinking with other men?

297
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,420
Right.

298
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,180
The men who poured my drink

299
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,939
were all dazzling handsome,

300
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,939
just like the characters in novels.

301
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,780
I bet it works.

302
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,339
As long as Zheng gets sick of me temporarily,

303
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,540
he won't be tortured by

304
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,859
the love poison any more.

305
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,699
I know exactly all you did

306
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,939
in these days is to

307
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,420
calm me and

308
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,540
try not to stimulate my love poison.

309
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:32,939
But did you ever think about

310
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:33,859
that it might only

311
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,819
make me burn with jealousy

312
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,020
and even make it

313
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,339
more difficult

314
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,099
to heal?

315
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:43,219
No, no. It's not like that.

316
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,819
I didn't drink with any men.

317
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:45,699
I just sprinkled some

318
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,059
wine on myself.

319
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
It's all Song Jianshan's idea.

320
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
Sure enough.

321
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,579
How could my wife

322
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:55,380
think of such a mean trick?

323
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,219
Does it hurt now?

324
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,780
Let me...

325
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
You go back and have a rest now.

326
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,579
Love hurts.

327
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,579
How could I sleep soundly

328
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,859
without Baiwan's company?

329
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:14,219
You're fooling me again, right?

330
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,260
It's you who did wrong.

331
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,699
And you're suspecting me.

332
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:19,459
I'm not.

333
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,339
I know I did wrong.

334
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,099
I really do.

335
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,780
You've already in such pain.

336
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:25,979
It must be more painful

337
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,699
when I'm around you.

338
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,099
All right.

339
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,699
Looks like

340
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,140
it's gonna be a

341
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,979
sleepless long night.

342
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,459
What should I do now?

343
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,540
Zheng got upset again.

344
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,219
How could it be possible?

345
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:04,780
It's all your lousy idea.

346
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,180
Wasn't it you who force me to think of it?

347
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,219
You...

348
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:12,219
What should I do now?

349
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:15,300
What should I do to make Zheng happy?

350
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:18,859
Haven't I long since

351
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:19,780
told you?

352
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,180
All you need to do is being cute.

353
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,979
Especially the last move.

354
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,979
Stop teaching her

355
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,099
such nonsense.

356
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,939
Fine.

357
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:28,260
I quit.

358
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:29,900
Save your strength.

359
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,020
If you ask me,

360
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:37,620
Lord Qu is the one who's acting like a spoiled child.

361
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,180
Zheng

362
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,660
is being cute to me?

363
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,140
Try to recall

364
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,020
the things you did that would

365
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,579
make Lord Qu happy.

366
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:56,140
And just follow suit.

367
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,339
Right.

368
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:03,540
I got it.

369
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,099
See you at seven p.m. in the yard.

370
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,260
I'm going to

371
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,859
make you happy.

372
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Go kill them

373
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,099
and avenge me.

374
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:37,859
Your Majesty

375
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:39,979
The traitors attempting to escape

376
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,500
have all been captured,

377
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,059
waiting for your instructions.

378
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,020
At the moment, our immediate concern

379
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,300
is to revenge for the former Host.

380
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,099
At this critical moment,

381
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,300
how dare you cop out?

382
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,780
Fine.

383
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:06,180
Capable men choose the right leader to serve.

384
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,620
I won't embarrass you this time.

385
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,380
Anyone who wishes to leave

386
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,780
may leave now.

387
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:20,140
Show some gratitude.

388
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,819
Thank you for your kindness, your majesty.

389
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:07,660
Your Majesty

390
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,219
What?

391
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,299
Is there anything wrong?

392
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,259
My majesty, it's legitimate

393
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,340
you killed the traitors as the law instructs.

394
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,380
But

395
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,340
you haven't got

396
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:18,660
the last two pages of the cannon.

397
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,699
It's better not to use

398
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:21,499
the skills from Puyuan Canon

399
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:22,739
before we find the solution.

400
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,340
Otherwise your body will be harmed.

401
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,420
The solution? Who cares?

402
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,779
See if I even care the Nonuple Palace.

403
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,299
Your Majesty

404
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:31,939
The demon skill is harmful for the body.

405
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Better not seek instant benefits.

406
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:33,900
Otherwise...

407
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,860
That's right, your majesty.

408
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,979
Please take care of your body.

409
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,060
Your Majesty

410
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,739
Your Majesty, spare my life.

411
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,140
I can handle the demon skill

412
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,620
when it comes back to hurt me.

413
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,939
Where are you going?

414
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,580
What?

415
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:00,499
Now I have to inform you in advance

416
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,380
before I go anywhere?

417
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:03,459
Don't forget

418
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:04,180
you promised me

419
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,060
to vitalize Nonuple Palace.

420
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,459
You are really into the Nonuple Palace, right?

421
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,860
You can have it now.

422
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,699
I have

423
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,539
bigger fishes to fry.

424
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,939
Baiwan, you've already got an idea

425
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,299
how to cheer me up?

426
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,860
Not only I knew

427
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:16,660
how to cheer you up,

428
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,779
but I knew

429
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,060
how to keep you from

430
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:20,180
love poison's torment.

431
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,459
Zheng

432
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,739
Do you remember this red string?

433
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:45,860
Sure.

434
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,979
When I was injured,

435
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,459
you had been playing the lyre

436
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,900
outside the window and singing me to sleep.

437
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,820
So today I'm here to give you a dance

438
00:21:57,979 --> 00:21:59,380
to cheer you up.

439
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:01,900
But,

440
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,019
please stop getting angry with me

441
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,900
and no more heartaches.

442
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,259
Okay?

443
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:09,820
How could I still be angry

444
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,019
when I see your graceful dance?

445
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:14,539
How about

446
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,699
I give you an accompaniment?

447
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:18,699
Well, maybe

448
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:20,340
the music you played for me down the hill.

449
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,420
To the End of Time

450
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:23,939
Okay.

451
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:47,580
Zheng

452
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,299
Do you like

453
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:52,539
my dance?

454
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,420
You're trying so hard to cheer me up,

455
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:57,660
I like it so much.

456
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,979
Then stop getting mad at me,

457
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,219
and stop making me

458
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,140
worried about your heartaches.

459
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,100
Can you do that for me?

460
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,900
After you get cured,

461
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:10,299
we'll...

462
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,060
We'll love and accompany

463
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,060
each other for the rest of our lives.

464
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,900
Baiwan

465
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,219
I can do it.

466
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,420
I can do all the thing you said.

467
00:25:58,539 --> 00:25:59,420
Zheng

468
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:01,299
Zheng

469
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,739
Zheng

470
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,499
You're awake.

471
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:51,019
How's your sleep?

472
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:53,459
Why did you bring me here?

473
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,299
What do you want?

474
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,939
This is our home.

475
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,900
You're supposed to come back.

476
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:02,660
What are you talking about?

477
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:10,420
Five years ago, you promised

478
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,340
to bring me Baiyu pastry

479
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:13,219
when my eyes got cured.

480
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,660
You failed to keep your word.

481
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,420
But I won't blame you.

482
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,100
As long as you can stay with me,

483
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:23,739
I can get over

484
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,979
all the things happened before.

485
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,340
It's not gonna happen.

486
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:29,620
Qingyun

487
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,620
Don't make it worse.

488
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:46,580
I've done nothing wrong.

489
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,860
If anybody did wrong, it's you.

490
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,820
You said you would come back to me.

491
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:58,499
You said you'd be the first to see

492
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,299
when I opened my eyes.

493
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:02,860
I've been waiting for you.

494
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,860
But why does it end up like this

495
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,539
after you're back?

496
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:18,860
Qingyun

497
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,060
Stop practicing the demon skills.

498
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:21,939
You'll end up like your father

499
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,539
if you go on like this.

500
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,660
Father

501
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,219
He's already dead.

502
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:34,140
Now I am the new host

503
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,779
of Nonuple Palace.

504
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,660
The most powerful man in the martial arts world.

505
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
Chu

506
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,019
Be with me.

507
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:45,580
Then we can go back

508
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:46,779
to the old times.

509
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,219
Let's avenge my father together.

510
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,219
Let's vitalize the Nonuple Palace together.

511
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,499
In the past, we had been deceived

512
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,900
and manipulated

513
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,499
by Jing Yuan.

514
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,820
We killed many of the innocent.

515
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,660
We were so wrong.

516
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,180
Both Nonuple Palace

517
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:05,539
and the old Chu

518
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:07,459
are all wrong.

519
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,820
We can't go on like that.

520
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,100
All wrong?

521
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:16,779
How about me?

522
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,660
How about the vows

523
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,620
we took together?

524
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,580
I always thought of you

525
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:22,979
as my little brother.

526
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:25,420
Zheng is the one of my life,

527
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:26,459
and the only one.

528
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,259
No.

529
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,539
It's not true.

530
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,979
Chu

531
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:52,180
Chu, don't leave me.

532
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:55,660
Qingyun, trust me.

533
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:57,820
You still have time to make it up.

534
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:00,180
You are so

535
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,580
wrong-headed.

536
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:03,340
It's all for Qu Zheng, right?

537
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,100
The real wrong-headed one

538
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:06,140
is yourself.

539
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,420
Zheng

540
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:19,219
How dare you

541
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,779
come to the home of Chu and me?

542
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,340
I'm here to

543
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,660
save my wife

544
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,019
back to Tingqin Garden.

545
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,820
Wife?

546
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:06,420
Zheng

547
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:13,699
Qingyun

548
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
The demon force inside your body

549
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,420
is still threatening your life.

550
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:18,140
Using the demon skill now

551
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:18,979
could only end up breaking up the

552
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,420
circulating passages in your body and die.

553
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Save your

554
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:23,539
crocodile tears.

555
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,100
Don't do it, Zheng.

556
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,620
Qingyun

557
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,180
Qingyun

558
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,499
Qingyun

559
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,699
Chu

560
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,779
I can't see you again.

561
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,459
Qingyun

562
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,219
You are not a bad person.

563
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,900
But you're in a bad

564
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,219
path right now.

565
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,180
So what?

566
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,739
Nothing matters to me

567
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,459
but you.

568
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,860
But the obsession would only

569
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,860
make you suffer from

570
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,019
endless pains and torments.

571
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,779
I can teach you the skills

572
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,620
on the last page of Puyuan Canon,

573
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,380
if you wish.

574
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,580
You can practice them right now.

575
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:13,979
Even if you can't return

576
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,100
to your former level,

577
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,979
at least it can save your life.

578
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:19,060
You killed my father

579
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,779
and stole my wife.

580
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,459
How dare you

581
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,620
confuse me with this trick?

582
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,620
I know you want

583
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:25,860
me to clear your love poison.

584
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,699
Cut your wishful thinking.

585
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,019
Qingyun

586
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,459
You'll die if the demon force

587
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,420
keeps staying in your body.

588
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,380
It's not up to you to tell me what to do.

589
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:36,739
Listen,

590
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,860
I don't care about

591
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:39,539
your skills.

592
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,459
As long as the love poison

593
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,219
is in your body,

594
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,820
you can never approach Chu.

595
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,620
Don't expect you can

596
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
stay with her for life.

597
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,180
That's enough.

598
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,140
I won't give you a hard time.

599
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,459
When we come back to Tingqin Garden,

600
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,739
I'll send the solving skills

601
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,219
to Nonuple Palace.

602
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:05,340
You're willing to let us go?

603
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,060
Save it.

604
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:08,380
Kill me as you want.

605
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:12,060
You are blind

606
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,580
and have lost your inner power.

607
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,420
I won't harm you.

608
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,219
Baiwan, let's go home.

609
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,259
This blank tablet

610
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,620
belongs to Chu.

611
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:23,860
She should be buried

612
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:25,420
beneath it.

613
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:27,739
From now on,

614
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:32,860
Chu won't exist in this world.

615
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,899
Let's go.

616
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,419
Chu

617
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:10,339
Don't go.

618
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,060
Chu

619
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,660
Qingyun

620
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:14,140
Don't leave me.

621
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,419
Don't leave me.

622
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:16,739
Qingyun

623
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,100
It's okay.

624
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,699
You got me.

625
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:22,899
I'll take you away from all of these.

626
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,180
I'll take you to

627
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:25,779
see the best doctor.

628
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:27,299
We'll have a life

629
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,339
as any normal couple.

630
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,500
I'll take care of you for the rest of my life.

631
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:36,660
Right.

632
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,180
I got you.

633
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:39,259
I got you.
