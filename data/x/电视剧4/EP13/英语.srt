English subtitles are available

00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:40,167
Fall in Love with a Fox EP13

3
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,485
Now, all sects

4
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,045
have changed their attitude to Tingqin Garden

5
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:46,005
since the wedding night in Taoyuan Valley.

6
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:48,525
Some people even said that

7
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:49,804
what you did is to provoke

8
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:50,765
Alliance of Martial Arts.

9
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:52,845
It was urgent that night.

10
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:53,965
As long as I can prevent

11
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:55,564
those people of Nonuple Palace from taking Baiwan away,

12
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:57,525
I wouldn't regret.

13
00:01:57,965 --> 00:01:58,764
But...

14
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:00,084
What?

15
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:02,165
I have surveyed the

16
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:03,525
Young Host of Palace.

17
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:05,205
As you expected,

18
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:06,805
Qingyun

19
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:07,924
and Chu

20
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:09,204
grew up together.

21
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,885
Qingyun was blind since he was young.

22
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,285
It was Chu who has been taken care of him.

23
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:15,245
Therefore,

24
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:17,605
he is fond of Chu

25
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:18,965
deeply.

26
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:20,605
Five years ago,

27
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:21,565
Nonuple Palace declared that

28
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,885
Chu was disappeared.

29
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:25,164
Young Host was in pain.

30
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:26,204
It's a pity that

31
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,965
although Young Host of Palace was in deep love

32
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:30,245
and met Chu

33
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:32,204
five years later,

34
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:35,524
this time our Lord

35
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:36,925
seizes the initiative.

36
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:42,165
What do you mean?

37
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:49,445
I just think that

38
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:50,725
we took

39
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:52,325
Miss Jin to Tingqin Garden,

40
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:55,605
Qingyun

41
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,325
won't forgive us.

42
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:58,525
So what?

43
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:00,165
Whoever he is,

44
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:01,725
I won't

45
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:02,885
allow people of Nonuple Palace

46
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:04,045
to approach Baiwan.

47
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:05,844
Mrs.

48
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,045
Zheng, are you there?

49
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,004
Just leave them to me.

50
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:12,924
I can take care of him.

51
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:13,564
Okay.

52
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,284
Baiwan is coming.

53
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:18,245
Zheng, are you there?

54
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,484
Zheng, what are you going to do?

55
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:21,404
Go away.

56
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:41,364
Zheng

57
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:43,364
I took some breakfast for you.

58
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:45,244
It's so early.

59
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,445
Come in.

60
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:52,524
Zheng

61
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:54,244
Does it hurt?

62
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:55,804
No.

63
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,764
You haven't changed your clothes.

64
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:03,285
I'll call the maid in.

65
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,005
No.

66
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,885
She's a girl.

67
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,364
She can't change clothes for you.

68
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:16,364
Then, I'll ask Jianshan.

69
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:18,204
No, he can't either.

70
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:19,924
Why?

71
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,045
I'm your wife.

72
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:24,084
I can help you.

73
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,165
Don't bother others.

74
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:28,285
If you need any help,

75
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:29,644
I can do it for you.

76
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,204
Then,

77
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,285
how can you help me?

78
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:38,325
Let me see...

79
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:48,325
Young Mrs.

80
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,565
Head Escort Jin

81
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:50,364
left this morning.

82
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,325
He asked me to deliver the letter to you.

83
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:54,005
Left?

84
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,005
Qiuer, you finally got married.

85
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:00,204
So I come back to the Escort Agency.

86
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:01,165
I don't want to

87
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:02,325
see you cry.

88
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:03,605
So I didn't tell you.

89
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:04,845
From now on,

90
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,764
you and Linfeng

91
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:09,364
should support and love each other.

92
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,445
Then, I'll feel relieved.

93
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,084
Baiwan left.

94
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,764
Dad left, too.

95
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:19,204
How can you leave me here

96
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:21,005
alone!

97
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:22,244
Young Mrs., by the way,

98
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,364
I just heard...

99
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:24,445
Stop.

100
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:27,045
I'm sad now.

101
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:29,084
You asked me to inquire about

102
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:31,204
Miss Jin Baiwan, didn't you?

103
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:32,484
Baiwan?

104
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:34,084
Just tell me.

105
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,244
I just heard Lord of Valley and Mrs.

106
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:37,204
were talking about

107
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:38,405
Miss Jin Baiwan.

108
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:39,725
They said

109
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:42,684
Qu Zheng of Tingqin Garden is a renegade.

110
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:44,165
What?

111
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,084
Lord Qu

112
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:50,725
told me

113
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:51,885
he was attacked in the valley

114
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,324
the night before the wedding.

115
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,324
I was afraid of affecting your marriage,

116
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:58,085
so we just

117
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,525
hid it.

118
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:01,085
I thought

119
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:02,924
Taoyuan Valley

120
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,205
was their objective.

121
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:05,965
But at the wedding night,

122
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,285
Lord Qu stunned everyone

123
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:09,804
to take Jin Baiwan away.

124
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:11,484
Then I just understood that

125
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,364
all the issues

126
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:14,605
are linked with

127
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:15,684
the Lord

128
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:16,965
of Tingqin Garden.

129
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:19,645
His behaviors

130
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,205
not only pissed off the crowd,

131
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,124
but also affected our Taoyuan Valley.

132
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:24,965
Now all sects

133
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:27,324
think that Tingqin Garden and Jin's Escort Agency

134
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:28,165
are related with

135
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:29,165
Puyuan Canon case.

136
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:30,405
Your father-in-law

137
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:32,405
is afraid of embroiling our Taoyuan Valley,

138
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,965
so he left in advance.

139
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:35,645
If Jin Baiwan

140
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:36,605
was taken by

141
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:37,525
those of Nonuple Palace at that day,

142
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:39,004
then everything is okay.

143
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:40,605
Lord Qu

144
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:42,605
looks calm.

145
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:43,965
How can he be so stupid

146
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:45,804
in dealing with this thing?

147
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:49,004
Jin Baiwan and Jin's Escort Agency

148
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:50,364
have a close connection.

149
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:51,364
Feng

150
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:53,564
Take care of Miss Jin these days.

151
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,684
Don't allow her to

152
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:57,124
communicate with Jin Baiwan.

153
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:58,765
Otherwise, we may be in trouble.

154
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,045
No problem.

155
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,364
I will tell Qiuer.

156
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:04,444
They slander

157
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:05,765
Baiwan and Mr Qu.

158
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,085
I don't know the condition of Baiwan.

159
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:09,684
I have to figure out an idea.

160
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:18,205
That's it.

161
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,924
I'm Qiu Qiuer.

162
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,205
As long as I write the story

163
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:23,645
of Baiwan into my novels,

164
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:24,845
then all people will know

165
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:26,684
Baiwan and Mr Qu are innocent.

166
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:32,965
Young Master of Valley

167
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:35,124
Lord of Valley asks us to...

168
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:49,244
Qiuer and Miss Baiwan

169
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:50,244
have a good relationship.

170
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:51,884
It's not easy to cut their connection.

171
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,564
The words I just said

172
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,765
were to relieve

173
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:55,725
my parents.

174
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:57,725
After all, she

175
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:58,765
went here alone.

176
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,205
She must be lonely and helpless.

177
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:03,525
Jueming

178
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,285
You

179
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:06,405
send some

180
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:07,845
dishes she likes to her room tonight.

181
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:08,765
Okay.

182
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:14,884
I bought the food,

183
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,004
medicine,

184
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:17,285
and sugar.

185
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:18,444
Is there anything I need to buy

186
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,564
for Zheng?

187
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:25,645
That's it.

188
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:30,765
Zheng is boring

189
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:31,924
since he's sick.

190
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:34,045
I can buy him novels.

191
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:42,364
You even have

192
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,405
novels written by Qiu Qiuer?

193
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:44,804
We have

194
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:45,804
all Qiu Qiuer's novels.

195
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:47,124
There are only a few.

196
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:48,484
The others are in the store.

197
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:49,845
I can take them

198
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:50,845
for you to have a look.

199
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:51,725
Okay.

200
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:53,004
Wait a moment.

201
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:59,364
Spoony Royal Highness.

202
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:00,444
It was out of print.

203
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:01,765
How can you have it?

204
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:04,965
The No.1 Husband.

205
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:06,684
It's my favorite novel.

206
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:08,605
Miss

207
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:10,165
Is the novel in your hand

208
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:11,324
that interesting?

209
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,605
Yes.

210
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:17,364
You can have a look.

211
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:18,165
Then,

212
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,444
why is it interesting?

213
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,364
I admire the No.1 husband

214
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:26,684
shield his wife from the glare of the sun,

215
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:29,045
and they chat under the tree.

216
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:34,085
Zheng, it's you!

217
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:35,444
I didn't recognize

218
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:36,444
that it was you

219
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:37,525
just now.

220
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:38,564
I didn't see you

221
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:39,924
since the morning.

222
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:41,324
I'm worried about you.

223
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:44,645
So you are here to...

224
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:45,765
No.

225
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:47,605
I'm afraid you're boring.

226
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,124
So I want to buy a novel for you.

227
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:49,965
But I don't know

228
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:51,205
which one you like.

229
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:52,605
I think

230
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,085
the one in your hand

231
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:55,004
is good.

232
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,004
This one?

233
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:58,684
No.

234
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:00,165
Why not?

235
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:02,165
Since you like it,

236
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:03,405
it must be a good novel.

237
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,045
I need to know

238
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,324
my wife's preference.

239
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:14,204
They use lotus leaves together to keep the rain off.

240
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,204
Do you like it?

241
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:25,485
Gently kissed her mouth with his mouth

242
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:27,525
and swallowed the cake.

243
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:28,444
It's interesting.

244
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:34,365
I learned a lot

245
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:36,804
from The No.1 Husband.

246
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,005
Is this your favorite

247
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,165
plot in the novel?

248
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,365
It's indeed good

249
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:10,604
with a good title.

250
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:12,324
Since you like

251
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:13,724
the novel,

252
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:15,684
I need to work hard

253
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,125
to be the No.1 husband

254
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:17,844
in your mind.

255
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:20,084
Let's go home.

256
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:22,285
It's a good idea.

257
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:25,285
You...

258
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,405
I bought you much food.

259
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,885
I'll make you some soup.

260
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:30,604
Let's go.

261
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,045
Alright, this is the last dish

262
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:41,444
ginseng chicken soup.

263
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:42,684
Zheng, let's enjoy the meal.

264
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:43,804
You worked hard, daring.

265
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:44,844
No.

266
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,045
Let's have a taste.

267
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,645
Taste it when it's still hot.

268
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:52,444
Here.

269
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:56,285
What's wrong?

270
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,684
Let me help you.

271
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:01,724
Take care.

272
00:12:01,844 --> 00:12:02,844
You can hit me,

273
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,165
but can't eat a meal?

274
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:04,885
How about it?

275
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,485
One more taste.

276
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:10,645
What do you want to eat?

277
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:11,405
I'll feed you.

278
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:13,165
This one or that one?

279
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:15,604
Purple yam?

280
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:16,444
This one?

281
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:17,444
That's enough.

282
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:18,405
I can't bear it.

283
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:19,684
I don't want to eat.

284
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:22,485
Don't bother us.

285
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:26,165
You are so

286
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:27,564
suitable.

287
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:30,645
Zheng, what do you want?

288
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:31,444
I can feed you.

289
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,485
This one.

290
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:33,165
This one?

291
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:33,804
Here.

292
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:51,285
You have drunk the medicine.

293
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,165
Just have a rest early.

294
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:54,204
I gotta go.

295
00:12:56,924 --> 00:12:57,604
What's wrong?

296
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,365
Does it hurt?

297
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:00,924
No.

298
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:02,684
You shall go.

299
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:04,564
No.

300
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,005
What if

301
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:06,804
you hurt again?

302
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:09,005
Or

303
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:11,204
you can tell me a story.

304
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,964
Maybe

305
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:14,765
I'll be sleepy when listening to it.

306
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:16,964
Okay.

307
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:18,525
I'll tell you a story

308
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:19,844
in Bamboo Annals

309
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:21,125
you always read.

310
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,804
That's so boring.

311
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,645
Which one do you like?

312
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:32,125
This one.

313
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:35,604
Why is it here?

314
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,324
You like it.

315
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:42,444
Of course, I'll buy it

316
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:43,765
and learn from it

317
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,365
to win your favor.

318
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:47,324
No.

319
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,604
I want to listen to this novel.

320
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:56,045
Alright.

321
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:57,804
I'll tell you the story.

322
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:01,964
Mr Xu said,

323
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:05,285
"As long as you're alright,

324
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:09,285
I am willing to do anything."

325
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:30,844
You worked hard all day long for me.

326
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:33,525
It's my fault

327
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:35,485
to ask you to tell me a story.

328
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:03,804
It's my fault

329
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,285
that you were hurt.

330
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:13,765
No.

331
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:16,604
Because of you,

332
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:19,924
I didn't descent into hell.

333
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,724
I have punished the rogues

334
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:37,045
that offended you.

335
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:48,405
I'm Xu Yifei.

336
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,804
Can I know

337
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,485
your name?

338
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:10,724
Baiwan

339
00:16:11,964 --> 00:16:12,684
Don't remember

340
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:14,005
your past.

341
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:15,844
Although you didn't

342
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:16,844
remember me five years ago,

343
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:19,125
I just hope

344
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:19,645
you can

345
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,084
live a happy life

346
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:22,684
like this.

347
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:30,405
Young Mrs.

348
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:33,405
It's time for meal.

349
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:37,604
Young Mrs.

350
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:39,444
Are you

351
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:40,444
writing novels again?

352
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:42,844
No.

353
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,405
I'm writing a letter to my dad.

354
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:47,525
Okay.

355
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:49,084
Young Mrs.

356
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:50,525
Just listen to me.

357
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:51,324
Don't

358
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:52,444
write novels again

359
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:53,724
in the future.

360
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:55,365
That's all.

361
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:56,084
I shall go.

362
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:01,645
No.

363
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:03,165
It's too dangerous to write novels here.

364
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:19,844
Qiuer

365
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:27,204
Yes?

366
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:28,485
Nothing.

367
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:31,724
Jueming

368
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:33,324
Ask the cook

369
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,444
to prepare two dishes of cakes

370
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:35,765
for young Mrs.

371
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:37,525
Don't let her be hungry again.

372
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:38,684
Okay.

373
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,045
I heard that Miss Jin

374
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:55,245
is obedient these days.

375
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:57,405
Thanks to your discipline,

376
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:00,005
Muqiu is obedient.

377
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:01,165
In these days,

378
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:02,804
she was learning needlework

379
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:03,765
in her room.

380
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:05,405
As for her behaviors,

381
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:06,924
she's more dignified than before.

382
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:10,525
Since she's in our Taoyuan Valley,

383
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:12,204
it's a must to be dignified.

384
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:14,324
It's not appropriate to be crazy.

385
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:18,405
Mother

386
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:20,924
It's windy outside.

387
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,045
What about having a rest in the room?

388
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,405
Why are you hiding me?

389
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:27,165
What's it?

390
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:36,485
Mrs.

391
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,285
These are the novels of Miss Jin.

392
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:39,444
What do you want to do?

393
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:40,765
Such stuff

394
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:42,525
can't occur in our Taoyuan Valley.

395
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,925
Fenger, fire them.

396
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:48,804
You want to fire my novels?

397
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:50,844
No way.

398
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:52,205
Mother

399
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,324
It's indeed her fault to write novels.

400
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:55,364
But such punishment

401
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:56,604
is too serious.

402
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:57,644
We Taoyuan Valley

403
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,564
won't bear them.

404
00:18:58,765 --> 00:18:59,364
Mother

405
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,485
As Young Master of Valley,

406
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,005
do you want to shield her?

407
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:05,084
Take her away.

408
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:07,285
Young Mrs.

409
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,564
Don't touch me.

410
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:09,604
That's my stuff.

411
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:10,765
Don't fire it.

412
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,765
I spent a lot of time on it.

413
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:14,965
Fenger, you fire it.

414
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:29,005
What are you waiting for?

415
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:36,124
No.

416
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:39,884
If I don't fire them,

417
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:41,445
mother won't forgive

418
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:42,164
Qiuer.

419
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,045
Qiuer

420
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:46,205
If you're angry,

421
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,084
just be angry at me.

422
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:50,404
It's my fault.

423
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:52,564
Please don't fire them.

424
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,324
No.

425
00:19:53,445 --> 00:19:53,925
Young Mrs.

426
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:55,084
No, it's my fault.

427
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,324
I can do anything

428
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:58,245
as long as you don't fire them.

429
00:19:58,404 --> 00:19:59,765
Don't fire them.

430
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:01,205
No.

431
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:02,245
No. No.

432
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:04,245
No.

433
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:09,525
No.

434
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:11,925
No.

435
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:22,765
Rules in Taoyuan Valley

436
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:24,205
are right?

437
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,084
Why do I feel so sad

438
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,084
when I obey them?

439
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:34,485
You indulge her too much

440
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,685
so that she can do such things.

441
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,245
If you don't teach your wife,

442
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:41,485
I'll do it for you.

443
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:44,644
Come with me.

444
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,445
Release me.

445
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:15,485
Are you okay?

446
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:18,045
Young Mrs.

447
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:20,765
Just listen to me.

448
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:21,884
Don't mind it.

449
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:25,005
After all,

450
00:22:25,164 --> 00:22:26,485
you will live a whole life

451
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:28,164
in the Taoyuan Valley.

452
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:32,604
A whole life?

453
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:34,445
You're the wife of Young Master of Valley.

454
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:35,564
That's for sure.

455
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:39,124
No.

456
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:40,765
I can't live a whole life here.

457
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:41,884
Young Mrs.

458
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:50,965
Young Master of Valley

459
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:52,925
It was her fault.

460
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,324
Why are you

461
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:55,404
punished for her?

462
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:56,725
You got the caning

463
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:58,364
and are copying women's commandments for her.

464
00:22:58,564 --> 00:22:59,164
That's too much.

465
00:22:59,285 --> 00:22:59,804
Jueming

466
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:01,925
Young Master of Valley

467
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:02,925
There's bad news.

468
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,604
Young Mrs. wrote a letter for you and left.

469
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:09,364
I'm gone.

470
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:11,525
You Taoyuan Valley people have pushed me too far.

471
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:12,965
You can regard it as we have divorced peacefully.

472
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:14,564
From now on, we're strangers.

473
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:19,725
This...

474
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:23,725
I'm supporting you.

475
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:25,164
You should have energy now,

476
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:26,725
But

477
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:28,005
you're painstaking.

478
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:29,604
No.

479
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,324
You should have recovered.

480
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:35,324
How could it become serious?

481
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,084
No.

482
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,285
You were hurt in the chest,

483
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:43,604
not the lags.

484
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:45,485
And last night,

485
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:47,005
you picked me up and sent me to my room.

486
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:48,765
You finally discovered.

487
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:50,205
You cheat me again.

488
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:51,445
It's you who asked to

489
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:52,205
support me

490
00:23:52,324 --> 00:23:53,404
to go for a walk outside.

491
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:54,644
I have no fault.

492
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:58,245
I know.

493
00:23:58,685 --> 00:23:59,725
If you hurt,

494
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,084
you'll say nothing.

495
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:02,404
You look sick

496
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:03,164
and ask me to do a lot of things,

497
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:04,404
so you must have recovered.

498
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:06,045
You know me a lot.

499
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:08,164
You're a cunning fox.

500
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:11,324
So,

501
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:12,445
since you're alright,

502
00:24:12,804 --> 00:24:14,644
I want to go back to Jin's Escort Agency.

503
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:15,525
Last time,

504
00:24:15,525 --> 00:24:16,404
when we left Taoyuan Valley,

505
00:24:16,564 --> 00:24:17,164
I didn't

506
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,525
even tell Head Escort Jin.

507
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:22,644
You wanna leave?

508
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:24,644
Okay.

509
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:26,245
I won't leave.

510
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:27,045
I won't leave.

511
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:28,725
I won't leave.

512
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:30,644
You want to go back to Jin's Escort Agency

513
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:32,324
for a long time.

514
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:33,804
It seems that

515
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:35,965
our Tingqin Garden is not good enough.

516
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:38,084
Of course, Tingqin Garden is good.

517
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:40,604
But I can cook everyday

518
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:42,005
in the Jin's Escort Agency.

519
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:44,324
I don't know what to do

520
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:46,324
here.

521
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:48,404
You're a cook in Jin's Escort Agency.

522
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:49,564
In Tingqin Garden,

523
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:50,925
you're my wife.

524
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:52,644
It doesn't matter what you should do.

525
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,205
You should think about

526
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:56,045
what you can do with me.

527
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:01,084
According to Miss Jin's novels,

528
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:03,765
we are

529
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:05,925
couples

530
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:08,285
now.

531
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:14,564
So have you figured out

532
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:15,804
what you want to do

533
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:17,245
with your love?

534
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:19,045
I can do whatever

535
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:20,045
I want to do?

536
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,045
Sure.

537
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:29,844
I have

538
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:31,205
a husband now.

539
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:33,445
But what should

540
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:36,045
couples do?

541
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,045
That's it.

542
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:43,285
I have read

543
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:44,245
a lot of novels.

544
00:25:44,404 --> 00:25:45,965
I can learn from them.

545
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:03,525
This plot is good.

546
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:05,604
I'll copy it.

547
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:21,445
Are these what you want to do?

548
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:25,844
But actually, I don't know.

549
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:27,364
I just read Miss Jin's novels,

550
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:28,324
and I want to

551
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:29,804
try them.

552
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,404
Okay, I can do

553
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,804
these things with you.

554
00:26:36,084 --> 00:26:36,644
Really?

555
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:40,525
Then, let's begin with the first one.

556
00:26:41,564 --> 00:26:43,005
In the novels,

557
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:45,164
couples would

558
00:26:45,364 --> 00:26:47,124
mold clay figurine

559
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:48,644
of each other in their minds

560
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:50,005
and form them by firing.

561
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:51,485
That's the love token.

562
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:53,765
I want to try it.

563
00:26:54,285 --> 00:26:55,485
Shall we start?

564
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:56,084
Okay.

565
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:03,884
I will mold a figure

566
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:05,285
more handsome than you.

567
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:08,844
You can be relieved.

568
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:16,604
Don't steal a glance at mine.

569
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:23,844
You can't steal a glance at mine, either.

570
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:25,285
I didn't steal a glance at yours.

571
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:26,685
I just looked at it.

572
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,205
Yours is ugly.

573
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:01,765
But it's you,

574
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:03,005
Baiwan.

575
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:04,725
Are you saying that

576
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:05,765
you're ugly?

577
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,245
I'm not ugly.

578
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:07,965
You...

579
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:09,205
Mine is ugly.

580
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:18,124
I'm done.

581
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:20,564
Me, too.

582
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:22,045
Let's disclose them.

583
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:25,084
One, two, three.

584
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:25,844
Disclose.

585
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:30,205
You mold a rabbit.

586
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:31,804
You mold

587
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:32,644
a cunning fox.

588
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:35,124
But your rabbit

589
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:37,124
is better than my cunning fox.

590
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:38,364
So,

591
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:39,404
in the future,

592
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:40,844
the cunning fox will listen to

593
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,644
the rabbit, okay?

594
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:44,285
Okay.

595
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:47,285
The cunning fox

596
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:49,045
will only listen to Baiwan.

597
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:09,485
I don't expect that Lord

598
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:10,804
really molds figures.

599
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:13,324
Our Tingqin Garden has established for three years.

600
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:14,445
It's the first time that

601
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:15,564
I see Lord is such happy.

602
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:16,564
No.

603
00:29:16,844 --> 00:29:17,604
I'm going to cook the dinner.

604
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,485
He's seduced by Baiwan.

605
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:20,844
So

606
00:29:21,404 --> 00:29:23,164
love is harmful.

607
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:24,285
Otherwise,

608
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:25,604
even Lord

609
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:27,685
would fail.

610
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:32,084
Miss Jin said that there is a wishing tree

611
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:33,644
outside the Furong Town.

612
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:35,005
Since we can't go there

613
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:35,844
to have a look at it,

614
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:37,725
we can make a wish to the sky lantern.

615
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:38,725
Miss Jin's novels also

616
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:39,765
have such a plot.

617
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:42,445
What wishes do you want to make?

618
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:45,364
I have a lot of wishes.

619
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:47,404
I wish you

620
00:29:47,604 --> 00:29:48,644
to recover as soon as possible.

621
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:49,844
I wish you

622
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,364
don't get hurt anymore.

623
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:52,725
I wish Miss Jin

624
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:54,604
and all people in Jin's Escort Agency

625
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:56,525
can live a peaceful

626
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:57,564
and happy life.

627
00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,925
I wish all people of Tingqin Garden

628
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:02,324
to be healthy and happy, too.

629
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,564
I also wish Puyuan Canon case

630
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:06,324
can be investigated clearly

631
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:08,285
so that people will know that Jin's Escort Agency is innocent.

632
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,445
It's your turn.

633
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:13,084
I have no wish.

634
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:15,604
Why?

635
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:17,084
Everyone has their wishes.

636
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:21,245
I used to have one.

637
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:24,124
But I have achieved it.

638
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:25,364
So I think

639
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:26,604
I can work hard

640
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,324
to achieve other wishes.

641
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:30,005
I'm afraid God may punish me

642
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,685
because of my greed.

643
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:36,604
Is your wish related to me?

644
00:30:37,324 --> 00:30:37,925
Sure.

645
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,124
So you don't make a wish?

646
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:43,804
Let's release the sky lanterns.

647
00:30:44,005 --> 00:30:44,445
Okay.

648
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:54,124
I have another wish.

649
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:55,084
I forgot it.

650
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:57,804
I wish

651
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:59,005
I can remember my past,

652
00:30:59,445 --> 00:31:00,364
so that I

653
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,925
have all my memories.

654
00:31:02,804 --> 00:31:04,245
But you said,

655
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:06,245
you don't want to

656
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:08,364
remember the one who hurts you.

657
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:11,285
I don't want to remember him.

658
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:12,604
But

659
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,084
maybe he's not my family.

660
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:15,005
I just

661
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:16,485
want to know my family

662
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:17,925
and find them as soon as possible.

663
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:20,084
Then, I can see them with you.

664
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:21,084
Okay.

665
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:37,285
Aren't you cold?

666
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:39,525
I won't be cold.

667
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:05,525
This time,

668
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:06,765
what do you want to try?

669
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:11,925
Rainy days.

670
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:14,084
Many couples in novels

671
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:16,445
are met and fall in love with each other

672
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:17,725
in romantic rainy days.

673
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:20,485
So I want to try it.

674
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:22,685
Okay.

675
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:26,245
We'll wait for a rainy day.

676
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,564
Everything is just alike five years ago.

677
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:33,844
Baiwan

678
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:35,884
I hope you can be happy

679
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:38,324
forever.

680
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:44,245
Although it doesn't rain,

681
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:45,644
it snows.

682
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,404
I only focused on the battles

683
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:49,564
in novels

684
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:51,005
of Miss Jin.

685
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:52,404
I didn't expect...

686
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:54,765
Being with the one you love,

687
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,005
it's also happy

688
00:32:56,205 --> 00:32:57,164
to do the stupid things.

689
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:01,644
There is a guy

690
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:02,765
who is willing to do the stupid things with me.

691
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:03,925
It's so good.

692
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:05,485
I also think so.

693
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:07,844
Which part do you think is good?

694
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:11,925
It's good to meet you.

695
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:17,164
Then, one of my wishes

696
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:18,285
is achieved.

697
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:19,804
Is that easy?

698
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:23,765
Although it's not a rainy day,

699
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:25,804
it's a snowy day

700
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,445
which is more romantic.

701
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:28,965
What a coincidence!

702
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:30,965
Last night,

703
00:33:31,164 --> 00:33:32,485
I read the novel you like.

704
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:34,925
On such days,

705
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:37,324
couples should

706
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:39,445
do this...
