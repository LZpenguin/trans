Fall in Love with a Fox EP08

3
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,300
Please speak frankly.

4
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,580
Miss Su

5
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,059
Mr Qu

6
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,900
I've known that

7
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,219
your engagement with

8
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,379
Jin Baiwan is fake.

9
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:51,379
So?

10
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,500
I have been adoring you for a long time, Mr Qu.

11
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:55,539
It was also me who managed to

12
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,739
beg the Puyuan Canon case

13
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:57,780
from my dad.

14
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,780
Well, what do you think of me?

15
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,820
All along the way,

16
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,780
you must have

17
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,780
read my mind.

18
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,380
No wonder Song Jianshan told me not to come here.

19
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:12,859
But I never expected that

20
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,979
Jin Baiwan, who has ulterior motives,

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,979
popped up.

22
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:18,780
Who has ulterior motives!

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,380
Well, Miss Su,

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,380
how did you know

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,859
she has ulterior motives on me?

26
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,299
You knocked her out,

27
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,579
took her sacred book,

28
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,339
and hung her in a tree.

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,859
But she still badgers with you.

30
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,619
Isn't it obvious?

31
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,740
What else did you find, Miss Su?

32
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,140
More than that.

33
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,700
Think about it.

34
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,020
All along the way,

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,220
she cooked for you and kept

36
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:43,100
pestering me for your news.

37
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,580
So you mean that

38
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,180
she's into me.

39
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,940
She's only a kitchen maid

40
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:49,820
and isn't qualified to like you.

41
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:51,380
What...

42
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,779
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:55,499
Jin Baiwan

44
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,339
How dare you to eavesdrop us?

45
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:58,339
Well, you bad-mouthed

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,059
me first.

47
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,820
I was just telling the truth.

48
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,220
Last time in the carriage,

49
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,580
Mr Qu would have been

50
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,820
offended by you

51
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,740
but for me.

52
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:08,660
I'm not an anthomaniac

53
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:09,339
like you.

54
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,619
You want him, right?

55
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:11,300
He's yours.

56
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,180
Baiwan

57
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:13,220
Mr Qu

58
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,419
Mr Qu

59
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,339
Leave her alone.

60
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:23,860
Isn't your engagement

61
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,020
fake?

62
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,059
So what?

63
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,300
Maybe I just wanna make it real.

64
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:31,499
One more thing, Miss Su,

65
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:32,779
don't ever keep doing such things

66
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,139
to Miss Jin, otherwise

67
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,100
I'll be unpleasant to you.

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,059
Baiwan

69
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:53,980
What do you come here?

70
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,260
Shouldn't you

71
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,099
coax your Su Zhuozhuo?

72
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,099
Since our engagement has not

73
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,379
been canceled officially,

74
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,499
you are still my fiancÃ©e.

75
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,180
So I owe you

76
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:03,020
an explanation.

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,219
I thought you forgot you are engaged

78
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,619
and started to develop

79
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:11,099
a romance with that Su Zhuozhuo.

80
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,059
Baiwan, you're jealous?

81
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,779
No, I'm not.

82
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:21,140
I'm just angry for her nonsense.

83
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,300
So you didn't cook for me

84
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,860
on the trip?

85
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:28,219
Well, someone

86
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,099
has to cook.

87
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,460
And I am a kitchen maid.

88
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,740
Then you didn't enquire

89
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:33,819
about me

90
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,059
from Miss Su, either?

91
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,819
Well, we just knew each other at that time.

92
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,740
Of course I wanna know more about you.

93
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,939
So you never

94
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:42,020
look at me with

95
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,980
that eager face

96
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,180
as Miss Su said,

97
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,099
right?

98
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,140
Well, I always look at you

99
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,140
like this.

100
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:10,939
What do you think of

101
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,899
this look, Baiwan?

102
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,499
It's surely natural and poised,

103
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,939
with nothing personal.

104
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,379
Nothing personal?

105
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,140
Why do you evade my eyes?

106
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,659
I didn't.

107
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,019
That's strange.

108
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,939
Why is my heart beating so fast?

109
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
You see yourself getting

110
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,180
alone with me

111
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,379
in your mind, right?

112
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,259
How...

113
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,900
How do you know?

114
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,139
Baiwan

115
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,059
You really feel nothing

116
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,740
romantic to me?

117
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,699
I...

118
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,019
Then I see.

119
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,139
It's all my

120
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,100
wishful thinking.

121
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,220
Well,

122
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,139
then...

123
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,900
Then what?

124
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,180
Then our engagement...

125
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,540
The young master takes

126
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:50,139
Miss Jin back.

127
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:50,660
They are back.

128
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,660
They are back.

129
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,019
Miss Jin's back.

130
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,499
Qiuer, what's the matter?

131
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,259
Is that your father?

132
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,379
Looks not so fierce.

133
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,579
Don't worry.

134
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,579
He's a modest and gentle man.

135
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,900
What about your mother?

136
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,139
The servants say that she's good at

137
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:32,740
lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting

138
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,900
and likes reading Commandments for Women.

139
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,139
She must be strict, isn't she?

140
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:40,499
Well, my mother comes from

141
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,059
a scholarly family,

142
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,780
observing the laws and rules.

143
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,980
Everyone in

144
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,139
this valley holds great

145
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,379
respect for her.

146
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,059
As for being strict,

147
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,579
she indeed is.

148
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,860
Regulations?

149
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,300
What kind of rules?

150
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:56,660
For example,

151
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:57,980
in this valley,

152
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,139
no private talk

153
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:01,340
between a man and a woman

154
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:03,180
around the corner is allowed.

155
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,379
Well, we come over here.

156
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,059
Anything else?

157
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,220
Well,

158
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,900
my mother doesn't like

159
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,420
to be talked behind her back.

160
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,220
Luckily she's not here.

161
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,100
This flowerpot

162
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,780
is her favorite.

163
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,019
You'd better leave it alone, Qiuer.

164
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,860
Then I'll put it back.

165
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,340
Never mind.

166
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,660
I'll just say it's me.

167
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,660
But...

168
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,180
Qiuer

169
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,420
Don't worry.

170
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,579
You are my dear future wife.

171
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,740
I will deal with all the things

172
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,180
in this valley.

173
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,300
All you need to do is waiting for the wedding.

174
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,579
Feng

175
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,819
Mother

176
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,139
What are you doing here, talking

177
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
with Miss Jin alone at this corner?

178
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,619
Miss Jin doesn't know

179
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,619
the rules of Taoyuan Valley.

180
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,819
What about you?

181
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,139
Mother, it's all my fault.

182
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,259
Miss Jin, see me in the main hall.

183
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,180
It's okay. Don't worry.

184
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,819
You must be tired after such a tough journey, Jin.

185
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,459
It's okay, never mind.

186
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:23,499
Mrs. Yu

187
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,259
Father

188
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:26,139
Qiuer

189
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,699
Greet to Mr Yu and Mrs. Yu.

190
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,619
Nice to meet you, Mr and Mrs. Yu.

191
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:31,100
Nice to meet you.

192
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:33,660
Jin

193
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:34,819
I've heard that you've been chased

194
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,300
by bandits along the road.

195
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,939
Are you hurt?

196
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,579
Thanks for your concern, Yu.

197
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,019
All along the way,

198
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,619
thanks Linfeng for protecting Qiuer,

199
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,660
Quier is safe and sound.

200
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,579
Yu

201
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,619
Fortunately

202
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,540
we had the foresight

203
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:53,420
to bring about

204
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,740
such a beautiful marriage.

205
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:56,780
That's right.

206
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:58,980
I feel quite pleased

207
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,340
to have Miss Jin

208
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,259
in our Taoyuan Valley.

209
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,699
Don't worry, Miss Jin.

210
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,699
I'll help you to get familiar with

211
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,459
the daily affairs and the various

212
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,219
regulations of the valley.

213
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:12,500
Regulations again?

214
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,020
What regulations

215
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,339
do I need to remember?

216
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:25,260
Bring it up.

217
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,219
Such two thick books.

218
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,380
You are mistaken in that, Miss Jin.

219
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,300
It's just a catalogue

220
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:37,699
of the rules and regulations.

221
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:38,979
The detailed rules

222
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,819
are kept in the bibliotheca.

223
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,500
It's available for you

224
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,260
to read yourself, Miss Jin.

225
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,939
You'll get to know it gradually.

226
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:46,859
You'll get to know it gradually.

227
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:48,699
It's in no hurry.

228
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,459
Please.

229
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,579
Sorry to let you stay in this

230
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:56,819
wing-room before the

231
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:58,579
wedding, Miss Jin.

232
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,020
Thank you.

233
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,579
Father

234
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,339
I don't wanna get married.

235
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:22,859
My daughter,

236
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,300
what are you talking about?

237
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,579
Here we are in the Taoyuan Valley.

238
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,420
Well,

239
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,780
the catalogue is

240
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,540
indeed a little thick,

241
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:36,459
but you'll get used

242
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,780
to it finally.

243
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,500
You'll get used to it.

244
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,140
No.

245
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,620
-I wanna go home.  -No, you don't.

246
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,540
-No, you don't.  -I miss Baiwan.

247
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:45,579
Miss Jin

248
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:47,300
Miss Jin

249
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,699
Finally you're here.

250
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,500
I miss you so much.

251
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,699
Baiwan's here.

252
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,900
How do you do, Mr Jin.

253
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,059
Great.

254
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,819
Do you have a hard trip?

255
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:55,859
No, not at all.

256
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,180
Where have you been?

257
00:11:58,339 --> 00:11:59,020
Who are you?

258
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,699
I've been worried to death.

259
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:01,059
It's okay. I'm fine.

260
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,380
I am Qu Zheng from Tingqin Garden.

261
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,459
It's great to see you're fine.

262
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,780
You are the

263
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,300
legendary Mr Qu.

264
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,819
So sorry that I didn't recognize you.

265
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,780
Mr Jin

266
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,739
May I have a word with you alone?

267
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:16,900
Sure.

268
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,420
Give them some minutes.

269
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:19,300
Please.

270
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,819
Please.

271
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,219
I said it long before that we

272
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,500
Taoyuan valley is an aristocratic family

273
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,059
of distinguished military commanders,

274
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,300
but we have strict family regulations.

275
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,859
However, you insisted on having Feng engaged

276
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,739
with that barbarous family.

277
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,300
Darling,

278
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,620
you have been talking about this

279
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,099
for over ten years.

280
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,180
Now Miss Jin

281
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,140
is already here.

282
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,260
What's the point to say

283
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,260
such words?

284
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:50,300
Mother,

285
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,020
Quier is a cheerful, lovely girl.

286
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,540
I'm sure you'll like her after

287
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,020
getting alone with her for some days.

288
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,939
I didn't expect so many things

289
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:02,300
to happen all along the way.

290
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,380
We Jin's Escort Agency

291
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,300
must be framed.

292
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,500
I'm trusted by Mr Su

293
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,500
to investigate this case.

294
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:11,500
I ran into Miss Jin

295
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,900
on the way.

296
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,620
She was deeply concerned about

297
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:15,620
Jin's Escort Agency.

298
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,339
Despite all the danger and difficulties,

299
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,620
she insisted on coming here

300
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:19,500
to inform you.

301
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,180
Thanks for your selfless help, Mr Qu,

302
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,099
otherwise Baiwan could

303
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,739
hardly keep herself alive.

304
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,059
No need to thank me, Mr Jin.

305
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:31,859
Although my trip was originally for

306
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,620
the Puyuan Canon

307
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,660
case,

308
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,260
I've gained a lot on the way.

309
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,420
Have you got anything?

310
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:41,660
I gained

311
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,660
myself a lady.

312
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,140
What?

313
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:48,859
You're engaged?

314
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,660
With Qu Zheng?

315
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,099
So

316
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,140
you are Mrs. Qu now,

317
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,140
first lady of Tingqin Garden.

318
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,219
No, not the first lady.

319
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:01,739
This engagement...

320
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,540
might...

321
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:04,939
probably...

322
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,459
be canceled soon.

323
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:07,900
Then there's no connection

324
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,500
between us anymore.

325
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,059
What are you talking about?

326
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,459
True love?

327
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
I fell in love with

328
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:19,900
Miss Baiwan at first sight.

329
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,180
Back in the Mole Gang,

330
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,140
we had a pledge of love

331
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,660
and said our marriage vows.

332
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,020
Then

333
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,739
Yu Chen kept standing in the way

334
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,780
to take the sacred book.

335
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,260
He even tried to

336
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,140
keep Baiwan in his resident.

337
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,300
But she chose me

338
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,260
over the wealth and rank

339
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,420
of Yu

340
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,099
and ran away with me.

341
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,420
I cannot

342
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:41,140
let her down.

343
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,260
He's such a liar!

344
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:43,939
Right.

345
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:45,099
He lied to

346
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,979
every man he met

347
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,859
on the way.

348
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,140
He tricked me well.

349
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,219
What?

350
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,699
He's so bad!

351
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,140
Well, not that bad.

352
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,900
Except for being a big liar,

353
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,180
he's a pretty nice guy.

354
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:58,699
What's more,

355
00:14:59,059 --> 00:14:59,900
he's a righteous

356
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,620
big hero

357
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,500
and has saved my life for several times.

358
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,739
What happened?

359
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,339
So it

360
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,459
was Baiwan

361
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:11,660
who saved your life.

362
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:13,819
Yes.

363
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,939
After having the knife wound,

364
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Baiwan couldn't sleep for the whole night.

365
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,020
Dare not to go beyond the discipline,

366
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,739
I stayed outside the room

367
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,459
to protect her as she fell asleep.

368
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:24,979
However, in the dream,

369
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,380
she kept calling

370
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,620
my name.

371
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:29,459
At that time,

372
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,979
I swore to myself

373
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:32,540
that I would protect her

374
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,620
for the rest of my life.

375
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,660
I shall never allow her

376
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:35,979
to get any hurt.

377
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,900
So

378
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,699
he has saved your life

379
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,459
for lots of times.

380
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,459
Well, I saved his life too.

381
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,739
Don't you think

382
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,579
it's romantic

383
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,380
when he took you to see the fireflies?

384
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,059
I think it's okay.

385
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,819
What a romantic story. I'm touched.

386
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,500
So what happened then?

387
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:08,579
After going through

388
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,099
all the hardships on the way,

389
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,059
our love is stronger than anything.

390
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,979
So we promised to each other

391
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,380
and signed the

392
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:17,780
marriage contract.

393
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,219
However...

394
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
What?

395
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,780
Recently Miss Jin

396
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:27,300
had some misunderstandings with me,

397
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,020
even planning to cancel our engagement.

398
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,180
It really makes me have no appetite

399
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,900
and no sleep at night.

400
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:40,219
Mr Qu, don't worry.

401
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,540
Baiwan is like

402
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,059
a daughter to me.

403
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:44,140
You can count on me

404
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,339
with this matter.

405
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,059
What a perfect match.

406
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,459
I'll try to convince her for you.

407
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,660
Thanks a lot, Mr Jin.

408
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,819
But for now,

409
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,380
due to the escort thing,

410
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,579
Baiwan has become the target for all.

411
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,500
Before the truth has been found out,

412
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,780
I think

413
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:00,739
it's better not to

414
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,059
present her in public.

415
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,939
Right,

416
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,780
you are right.

417
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,819
I can rest easily to trust

418
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,219
you with Baiwan.

419
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,339
But I think we should

420
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:17,660
inform

421
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:18,660
Mr Yu.

422
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,059
How about

423
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:21,140
discussing with him now?

424
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:22,420
Okay.

425
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,699
Wait.

426
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,219
In you words,

427
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,979
he's crafty but righteous.

428
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,099
He took care of you and lied to you at the same time.

429
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,020
Is he a good guy

430
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,180
or a bad guy?

431
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:39,660
Never mind.

432
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:40,380
It doesn't matter, anyway.

433
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:41,660
What matters is that

434
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,900
you like him since you first

435
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,780
brought up the idea of getting engaged.

436
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,099
Well,

437
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,459
I'm not sure.

438
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,900
Come on,

439
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,380
don't you know your own heart?

440
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,339
I suppose I don't.

441
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,699
You suppose you don't?

442
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,939
Well, maybe.

443
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,979
I might probably do.

444
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
What about him? Does he like you?

445
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,380
Well,

446
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,459
how could I know

447
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,979
if he's into me?

448
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,739
Let's go ask him if you don't know.

449
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,300
Come on, let's go.

450
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Let's go.

451
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,180
Miss Jin

452
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,699
It's not the right time.

453
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,260
I...

454
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,339
It's always the right time.

455
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,540
You said yourself

456
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:30,339
that Qu Zheng

457
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,859
is a liar who plays tricks.

458
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
He's indeed a liar...

459
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,140
Don't worry. I get your back.

460
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,020
She's the escort

461
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,780
Jin Baiwan, right?

462
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,420
Right,

463
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:38,059
it's her.

464
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,020
Who are you?

465
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,819
Jin Baiwan

466
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:40,900
We've been looking for you all along the way.

467
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:41,779
Don't worry, Miss Jin.

468
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:43,620
How dare you come to Taoyuan Valley?

469
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,219
What...what do you want?

470
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,860
Miss Jin

471
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:46,499
I am the

472
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,459
Miss Jin of the Jin's Escort Agency.

473
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,380
She must have received

474
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:50,499
the instructions from Jin's Escort Agency

475
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,140
to substitute the sacred book,

476
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:53,900
claiming that it's fake.

477
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,299
You are slinging mud at me.

478
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,499
You got no evidence.

479
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:57,060
Evidence?

480
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,539
We're here in the Taoyuan Valley

481
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,019
is to confront

482
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,140
Jin's Escort Agency.

483
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,699
You've come just at the right moment.

484
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,860
Having tied you up,

485
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,299
we can go confront Mr Yu then.

486
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:06,019
Right.

487
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:31,660
Who dares to touch a single hair of my love lady?

488
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,739
Love lady? Lady?

489
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:35,820
I got you.

490
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:41,900
My daughter

491
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:42,499
Father

492
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,860
They are slandering Baiwan.

493
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,939
Mr Qu, you said you would

494
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,380
track down the canon yourself.

495
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,140
But now you're

496
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:50,019
mixing with this

497
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:50,820
escort.

498
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,620
The custodian has turned the thief.

499
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,380
You two must have connived

500
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:53,299
to stole the book.

501
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,820
Right.

502
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,779
How dare you!

503
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,539
The fame of my Jin's Escort Agency is worldwide.

504
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,580
The rare treasures we escorted are countless.

505
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,140
Not a second did we

506
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,299
have the thought to

507
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,820
pocket the goods.

508
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,100
The book was escorted by me.

509
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:05,979
And I got framed on the way

510
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,699
for many times.

511
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,620
If I want it,

512
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,739
why didn't I take it

513
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,620
at the beginning?

514
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,380
Stop acting here

515
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:14,820
to clear

516
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,259
the suspicion.

517
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:17,779
Right.

518
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,739
Acting? I could act better

519
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,219
if I left the escort agency to

520
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,539
pretend that it got stolen.

521
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:23,580
Why did I even bother making a marathon

522
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:24,459
journey to the Yinxue Village?

523
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,180
How could it be possible?

524
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,739
Isn't she...

525
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,580
Many of you

526
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:34,380
have been to the home of Qing Songke

527
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:35,539
in Yingxue Village,

528
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:36,699
and you've seen the fake canon

529
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,380
with your own eyes.

530
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,420
I'm amazed that now you're playing dumb

531
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,580
and dare to

532
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:43,939
press my wife.

533
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,019
We are not here to get the canon,

534
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,499
but the great justice.

535
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:49,979
Right.

536
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,219
The great justice?

537
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,380
Where is the great justice

538
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,499
when you kept

539
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:54,580
pressing this weak young lady

540
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:55,860
and framed up

541
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,140
Jin's Escort Agency?

542
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,060
You...

543
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,699
Hold on, everybody.

544
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:01,939
Mr Yu

545
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,779
-Everyone. -Mr Yu.

546
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:03,900
What happened here?

547
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:05,340
Yu

548
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,259
Yu

549
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,180
This is the lord of

550
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,620
Tingqin Garden,

551
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,340
Qu Zheng.

552
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,219
Jin's Escort Agency has been framed

553
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,499
when we escorted the Puyuan Canon.

554
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,019
Thanks Mr Qu

555
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,299
for his selfish help.

556
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,140
Mr Qu

557
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,019
Well, you owe

558
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:22,939
us an explanation of the canon case.

559
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,900
Right.

560
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,900
Now that I am part

561
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,779
of the escort,

562
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,259
I would explain it clearly.

563
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,739
But I won't do it now,

564
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,219
when I am surrounded

565
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,420
and pressed by the wicked.

566
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:32,779
You...

567
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,979
Mr Qu is right.

568
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:35,420
I believe Mr Qu.

569
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,060
Everyone here,

570
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,860
it's a matter of great importance.

571
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,620
Given the fact that

572
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,019
grandmasters of all schools

573
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,820
have come to the Taoyuan Valley,

574
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,699
how about

575
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,620
Mr Qu announcing the truth?

576
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,660
Since Taoyuan Valley has been

577
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,100
well-known for justice,

578
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:54,860
I wholeheartedly agree with this plan.

579
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:55,939
Later,

580
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,380
I'll make it clear to the public.

581
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:58,660
Sounds okay.

582
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,660
Okay.

583
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:01,620
Now that we got

584
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,459
the resolution,

585
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,459
how about we put the bias aside?

586
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,420
All you heroes

587
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,620
come here originally for

588
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,499
my son's wedding.

589
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,699
I request all of you put the swords away.

590
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,620
Have a good rest

591
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,620
and enjoy yourselves

592
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:14,140
in the valley.

593
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,979
What do you think?

594
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,779
Of course we'll do it

595
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:18,939
for Mr Qu's favor.

596
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,219
Thanks a lot.

597
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,580
Please.

598
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:23,140
We'll take our leave.

599
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,299
For the details,

600
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:31,459
please come with me to the hall for discussion,

601
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,420
Mr Qu and Jin.

602
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:34,340
Okay.

603
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,140
I'd certainly be frank.

604
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,580
Please.

605
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:38,180
Please.

606
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,420
I'll be right back.

607
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:01,620
Baiwan

608
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:03,459
It turns out

609
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,299
that you've been living such

610
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,180
a hard life.

611
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:06,259
You must be exhausted.

612
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,140
No, not at all.

613
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,459
Look at me, I'm fine.

614
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:09,660
Mr Qu

615
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,779
called you his wife

616
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:11,979
in front of everyone just now.

617
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,420
He's so cool.

618
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,420
Well,

619
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,459
he was just

620
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,580
getting me out of trouble.

621
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,140
Just getting you out of trouble?

622
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,019
Why did he take the risk of offending

623
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,019
all the heroes?

624
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,299
In my view,

625
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,459
he must like you.

626
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:30,380
Like me?

627
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:32,060
How could you tell?

628
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,259
Even a fool can tell.

629
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:36,620
Answer me again.

630
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,219
Do you like him or not?

631
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,660
I'm not sure, for real.

632
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,739
You know me.

633
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,060
I have no experience

634
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,499
for liking others.

635
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:49,180
You idiot.

636
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,939
Alright, just leave it

637
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,900
to me,

638
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,699
the expert matchmaker.

639
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,900
What do you mean, Miss Jin?

640
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,420
You didn't ask him that question.

641
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,739
Is it okay to do that

642
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:04,900
for our girls?

643
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:06,939
Of course it's okay.

644
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:08,979
We're going to give this back to him.

645
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,219
The Puyuan Canon case is

646
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,380
no trivial matter.

647
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,420
Thanks for your efforts, Mr Qu.

648
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,140
They are out.

649
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,420
It's my responsibility.

650
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:20,739
Please.

651
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,340
Mr Qu, Mr Qu.

652
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:34,299
Miss Jin

653
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,420
Come on.

654
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,299
We're here to give you this,

655
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,100
and have a little chat maybe.

656
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,060
Mr Qu

657
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:57,699
Thanks for your heroic act today.

658
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,699
You not only saved the reputation

659
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,860
of Jin's Escort Agency

660
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,340
but also saved Baiwan.

661
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,219
No need to thank, Miss Jin.

662
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,979
It's a matter within my duty.

663
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,340
I wonder what the matter is

664
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,299
that Miss Jin came to me.

665
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:10,459
Baiwan is like a sister of me.

666
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,900
So

667
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,660
as her family,

668
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,779
I have some questions for Mr Qu.

669
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,660
Please speak frankly, Miss Jin.

670
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,060
I'll put it mildly.

671
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:24,420
When is the wedding day

672
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:25,219
of Mr Qu and Baiwan?

673
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,140
Are you going to stay in

674
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,219
Tingqin Garden after the wedding?

675
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,340
I heard that Tingqin Garden

676
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:29,100
is pretty close to

677
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,739
Jin's Escort Agency.

678
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:31,340
Is Baiwan free to

679
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:32,499
visit her family frequently?

680
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,699
I told you it's a fake engagement.

681
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:36,420
Fake engagement.

682
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,380
Real love!

683
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,580
Right, Mr Qu?

684
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:39,979
You are right, Miss Jin.

685
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:40,820
So

686
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,499
you like Baiwan, right?

687
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,259
I won't deny that.

688
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:48,140
You see?

689
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,860
I told you that he likes you.

690
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:54,420
Well,

691
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,620
Baiwan is my best friend.

692
00:25:58,219 --> 00:25:59,779
Now that Mr Qu are deeply

693
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:01,539
in love with her,

694
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,219
I can only reluctantly

695
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,019
agree with your marriage.

696
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:08,539
It's not the right time.

697
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,900
Why?

698
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:13,219
All along the way,

699
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,979
I can't help falling in

700
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:16,259
love with Miss Baiwan.

701
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:17,660
Unfortunately,

702
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:18,979
I've asked Miss Baiwan

703
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,459
for several times yesterday.

704
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,180
She has no romantic

705
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,140
feelings for me at all.

706
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,539
You really said that?

707
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:28,699
Miss Baiwan only

708
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,100
regards me as a friend.

709
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:31,620
And I know the love

710
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,620
cannot be forced.

711
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,699
How could I

712
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:36,660
force Miss Baiwan to marry

713
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,340
a man she does not love

714
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,219
in the name of marriage?

715
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,939
You don't know if she loves you!

716
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:42,100
Baiwan

717
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,660
I...

718
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,060
Do you like him or not?

719
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,739
Never mind.

720
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:46,180
Miss Jin

721
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,699
Stop embarrassing

722
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:48,660
Miss Baiman

723
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,660
and

724
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,939
stop hurting me.

725
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,420
The fallen flowers would like to float away with the stream,

726
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,699
while the stream has no feeling for fallen flowers.

727
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,660
Excuse me.

728
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:19,019
Go.

729
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:22,539
Baiwan

730
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
This is mine,

731
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,900
could I have it back?

732
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,539
Baiwan

733
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:46,539
It seems that

734
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:48,019
you hurt

735
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:48,979
Mr Qu deeply.

736
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:50,219
What did you say exactly?

737
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:51,620
He's so upset.

738
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,900
He's upset?

739
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,340
He's a cunning fox.

740
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,860
He'd swear black is white if he wants.

741
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,219
Miss Jin

742
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,580
Finally got you.

743
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,140
Mrs. Yu wants to see

744
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,539
you in the courtyard after dinner.

745
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:05,900
Baiwan, come with me.

746
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,699
I'm not going.

747
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:07,620
Go by yourself.

748
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,420
Why are you mad at me?

749
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,259
Think about it yourself.

750
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,100
Feng

751
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,660
Is everything okay?

752
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,259
Don't worry, mother.

753
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,459
Quier

754
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:25,739
Mrs. Yu

755
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:27,939
Feng said that

756
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,539
Miss Jin got strict family disciplines,

757
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,620
having a good command of lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy, painting,

758
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,939
and Confucian classics, right?

759
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,060
Mother

760
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:37,420
Qiuer is a well-read and

761
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,420
brilliant girl.

762
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,539
She can surly hold the

763
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:40,380
the womenfolk gathering successfully.

764
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,979
What is the womenfolk gathering?

765
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:46,739
It's a tradition

766
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:48,299
of Taoyuan Valley.

767
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,299
Every bride

768
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:51,420
needs to hold a banquet

769
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,860
inviting the ladies of

770
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,340
all the big families and

771
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:55,660
the chivalrous ladies in the ganghood.

772
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,979
Hold the banquet

773
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:58,860
all by myself?

774
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,900
Now that Miss Jin is about

775
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,900
to marry into the Taoyuan Valley

776
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,739
and become the lady of the whole family,

777
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,340
this banquet is just

778
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,739
for practice.

779
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,060
Nothing difficult.

780
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,180
When is it then?

781
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,380
It has been turbulent

782
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,459
due to the Puyuan Canon

783
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:14,459
case recently.

784
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,499
Jin's Escort Agency is also involved.

785
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:18,660
Since the Shiming gathering is around

786
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,259
the corner, what about

787
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,539
holding the two at the same time?

788
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:22,860
It comes so soon.

789
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,340
Qiuer

790
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,539
Don't worry.

791
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,739
I've prepared it for you.

792
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:30,100
This is the process

793
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,539
of the gathering.

794
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,100
I've written it down for you.

795
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,420
Everything would be fine as long as

796
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,580
you follow the instructions there.

797
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:36,860
It's just a chance to

798
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:37,939
know the ladies.

799
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,860
Mother will be your side.

800
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,820
Because of such a short time,

801
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,259
I come to direct you.

802
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:45,420
I heard from Feng that

803
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:47,820
Miss Jin has read the Woman Commandments.

804
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,140
Yes, I...I've read about it.

805
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,299
Feng also said that

806
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:53,979
Miss Jin is skilled at lyre-playing.

807
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,380
How about

808
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
playing a piece of song

809
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,499
to begin the banquet, Miss Jin?

810
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,380
Is that really her?

811
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:06,699
I'm sure

812
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,779
she died five years ago.

813
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:09,860
Whoever she is,

814
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,259
I won't allow her

815
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,140
to appear in front of me

816
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:14,860
like haunting ghost.

817
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,259
Lord Xueyue

818
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,180
You mean...

819
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,060
Feilian is in the charge of Lord Xueyue.

820
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,299
I will do whatever I am asked

821
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:23,779
by Lord Xueyue

822
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,539
and keep the secret for good.

823
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:27,340
Good for you to know that.

824
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:28,699
But

825
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,739
there are lots of masters in the valley.

826
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:31,979
And we still have the task of stealing the

827
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:33,060
Saussurea involucrata.

828
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,380
Is it...

829
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,939
Of course I know the priority.

830
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:40,900
Tomorrow's womenfolk gathering

831
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:42,860
is a good chance

832
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:46,219
to take her life.

833
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:52,019
Qi

834
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:54,459
I was delayed by some things.

835
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:55,499
This is your medicine.

836
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:56,499
I'm not injured.

837
00:30:58,539 --> 00:30:59,699
Your hand...

838
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:00,900
I heard that

839
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,380
you are from Jin's Escort Agency

840
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,580
and involved in the Puyuan Canon case.

841
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,259
Sorry

842
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,219
to keep it from you.

843
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,499
Look,

844
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:10,459
I bring you this.

845
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:11,779
It's from the lady of the valley.

846
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:12,979
A first-class tag of the retainer.

847
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:13,860
With this,

848
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,420
Steward Wang would never dare to bully you.

849
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:15,860
Here.

850
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:22,539
Why are being so nice to me?

851
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,539
It's nothing.

852
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:24,739
You are a younger brother

853
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:25,699
to me.

854
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:26,539
I like you.

855
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,499
Brother?

856
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:29,299
But I won't be

857
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,340
in the kitchen anymore.

858
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,820
Take care of yourself.

859
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,259
I gotta go.
