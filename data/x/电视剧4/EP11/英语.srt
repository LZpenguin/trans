English subtitles are available

2
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:40,167
Fall in Love with a Fox EP11

3
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,180
It's him again!

4
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,339
Stop!

5
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,780
Young Master

6
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:22,619
Give out my order,

7
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,420
block the whole valley.

8
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:24,299
Yes, sir!

9
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,619
What!

10
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,140
Shu got hurt!

11
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,259
Don't worry,

12
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,780
Young Master is fine.

13
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,060
What about Lord Qu?

14
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:36,780
I'm not quite clear about that

15
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,180
Lord Qu

16
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:39,859
No,

17
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,180
I'll go to see him.

18
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,660
Shu

19
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,220
Qiuer

20
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:46,779
I know

21
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,499
what happened at the warehouse yesterday.

22
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,660
Are you okay?

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,899
Let me see.

24
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:52,139
Young Master

25
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,180
has recovered.

26
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:53,940
But if he knew Miss Jin

27
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,580
is so worried about him,

28
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:56,740
he would be more than willing

29
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,860
to stay unrecovered for a few more days

30
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,259
so you may look after him.

31
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,860
Jueming

32
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,499
I'll leave you alone.

33
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:04,860
How are you?

34
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,020
I was so worried about you.

35
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,059
If something happened to you,

36
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,619
I...

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,820
Who are those evildoers?

38
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,380
They dared strike out at you

39
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,339
at Taoyuan Valley.

40
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,259
It's still under investigation,

41
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,619
and it's weird.

42
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,499
Thanks to Lord Qu's rescue.

43
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,300
I was too mean

44
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
to him before.

45
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,020
I didn't expect that

46
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,699
Lord Qu

47
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,619
is such a

48
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:32,380
gentleman.

49
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,699
Fortunately, he was not hurt.

50
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,499
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

51
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:39,020
Qiuer

52
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,820
You haven't

53
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,100
officially married me yet,

54
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,020
but you care about me so much.

55
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,540
It's all my fault.

56
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:46,779
Shu

57
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,099
Don't say so.

58
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,860
It's all about the evildoers.

59
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:51,899
By the way,

60
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,339
will they attack

61
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,899
Taoyuan Valley again?

62
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,619
It's not over.

63
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,499
You're still young,

64
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,379
but you need to

65
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:02,339
face it with me.

66
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,740
I feel so guilty.

67
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,300
Shu

68
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,420
You don't have to.

69
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,420
I will be your wife.

70
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,460
Whatever happened,

71
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,819
we'll stand and

72
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,819
face it together.

73
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,379
Besides,

74
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:15,939
My dad and Jin's Escort Agency are with us.

75
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:16,540
Don't worry.

76
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,860
Qiuer

77
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:19,460
It's my great honor

78
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
to have you be my wife.

79
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,180
Is this your medicine?

80
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:25,499
Let me help you.

81
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:31,819
Well...

82
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,059
Taoyuan Valley was blocked last night,

83
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,779
and no one broke out.

84
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,020
The two people should still be there.

85
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,059
There are many experts in Taoyuan Valley,

86
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,700
of course they dare not do that.

87
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,860
Then why didn't we

88
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,180
just catch them?

89
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:22,740
The man I fought with last night

90
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:23,659
wasn't him.

91
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,180
If we caught

92
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,339
those nonentities,

93
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,460
they must sacrifice them.

94
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:29,980
Then we'll lose

95
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:30,619
the clue.

96
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,540
What are you going to do next?

97
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,180
The scent-following finch!

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,780
-Qu...  -Lord Qu

99
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,459
Who is this girl?

100
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,699
Lord Qu, I'm Xiaocui.

101
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,980
You've saved my life before,

102
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,300
do you remember?

103
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,220
Xiaocui

104
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,379
I heard you were attacked last night,

105
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,379
and you beat them away

106
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,579
for Young Master.

107
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,900
I brought these pastries

108
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:15,059
to visit you.

109
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,019
Baiwan

110
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,540
I'm quite relieved

111
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:25,860
to see that you're fine.

112
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:33,579
Baiwan

113
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,340
I have important things to do right now,

114
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:36,019
I got to go.

115
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,459
Lord Qu

116
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,180
Lord Qu

117
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,619
I brought you these pastries.

118
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,939
Excuse me,

119
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,340
you can give it to me,

120
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,139
and I will give it to my husband.

121
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,100
I...

122
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,619
Thank you so much.

123
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:26,499
Where is the stuff?

124
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,340
Fortunately, guards of Taoyuan Valley

125
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,139
only searched the room,

126
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,499
not to the woods.

127
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,379
There's no time to lose.

128
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,780
It must be sent back immediately.

129
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:32,780
Then we'll

130
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,860
bring the saussurea back to the palace.

131
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,819
They're from the Nonuple Palace.

132
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,499
You bring the saussurea back.

133
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,420
I still have a thing

134
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,660
to do.

135
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:42,740
Lord Xueyue

136
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,019
Is it because of her?

137
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,819
I won't be at ease

138
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,740
if she is alive.

139
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:52,939
Young Host

140
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:54,980
Why are you here?

141
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,540
You're supposed to be asked.

142
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:58,300
Is it Host

143
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,139
who asked you to steal saussurea?

144
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:01,619
Young Host

145
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:04,740
I thought

146
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,860
what he usually makes you do

147
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,540
is to wear masks

148
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,619
to kill a few people.

149
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,660
It's him.

150
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,860
He turned out to be

151
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,139
Young Host of Nonuple Palace.

152
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,379
I didn't expect that

153
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,540
you even

154
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:16,980
stole things now.

155
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,660
We're Host's most trusted

156
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,740
Heisha.

157
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:21,220
Young Host, watch your words please.

158
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,259
Heisha

159
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,699
You're just executioners

160
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,300
to solve troubles for him.

161
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,379
There are lots of people in Taoyuan Valley.

162
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,819
Do you dare to stand in front of them

163
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,900
and tell who you are?

164
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:33,300
Young Master

165
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,900
It's not appropriate to argue here.

166
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,340
Then tell me,

167
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,379
why did he send you to steal saussurea?

168
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,259
Tell me,

169
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,459
otherwise I'll destroy it.

170
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:04,340
No.

171
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:05,939
The Host is waiting for saussurea to save him.

172
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:06,860
What's wrong with my father?

173
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,139
Come to me when you figure it out.

174
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,579
It's really him.

175
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,420
I can't believe you can restrain my palm strength.

176
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,860
Nonuple Palace always

177
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:24,980
has a good reputation in the world.

178
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:26,499
The manipulator

179
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:27,379
was him.

180
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:29,180
Whoever it is,

181
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,780
it is not a surprise.

182
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,019
No wonder that not only Envoy Xueyue

183
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,980
came to Taoyuan Valley,

184
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:35,939
but the Young Host of Palace

185
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,100
hid in the kitchen.

186
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,499
The Heisha they were talking about

187
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,660
are the group of elusive people

188
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,699
wearing masks.

189
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,340
It seems that

190
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
his power

191
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,180
not just cover

192
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,300
the Nonuple Palace these years.

193
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,740
Those Heisha

194
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,379
are assassins he secretly trained.

195
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:51,980
Zheng

196
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,340
Are we get closer

197
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,300
to the truth?

198
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:57,860
It's been five years.

199
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,780
All the sins he committed

200
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,180
against the Xu family

201
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,540
must be paid back.

202
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:13,699
You're on time.

203
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:14,500
Qingyun

204
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:15,979
Give saussurea back to me.

205
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:16,660
Neither you nor I

206
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:17,780
can afford to delay.

207
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:19,859
I can give you back,

208
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:21,859
but I have something to ask you.

209
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,260
Did you recognize

210
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,020
Chu long ago?

211
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,180
What did you say?

212
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,500
Still wanna lie to me.

213
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,260
Was it you

214
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:37,900
that day?

215
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,260
What happened five years ago?

216
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,780
Why did everyone tell me

217
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:42,380
Chu is dead

218
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:43,380
when I woke up?

219
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,540
It's been five years.

220
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,219
Haven't you forgotten her yet?

221
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:50,540
Jin Baiwan is Chu, isn't she?

222
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,900
So what?

223
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,979
She is the wife

224
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,859
of Lord of Tingqin Garden now.

225
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,819
What can you do?

226
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,699
Sure enough.

227
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,500
So you wanna kill her

228
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,020
at the womenfolk gathering!

229
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,420
You did this to me for her.

230
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,420
Well, then I guess my decision before

231
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,099
was right.

232
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:20,020
You can't kill me.

233
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:21,819
Otherwise

234
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:24,579
the Host is not gonna let you off the hook.

235
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:32,540
Who do you think you are?

236
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,540
You're just a tool.

237
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,140
I'm telling you for the last time.

238
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,140
If you try to kill Chu again,

239
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,859
I will never let you go.

240
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,140
I can't believe you don't even

241
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,819
care about my life because of her.

242
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,339
How can I

243
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,579
let her live?

244
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,260
Saving her life?

245
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,059
Who allowed you to save so many people?

246
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:09,540
Baiwan

247
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:13,219
Why are you here?

248
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:15,380
I haven't eaten

249
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,339
the pastries you prepared today.

250
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,579
Of course I'm here to ask for that.

251
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:19,900
I've thrown

252
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:20,900
the pastries from the girl away.

253
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,540
Well done,

254
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:23,500
I like it.

255
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,540
I like

256
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,339
what you said too.

257
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,260
What about the pastries you made for me?

258
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:39,859
They were also thrown away.

259
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,579
Because I'm angry today.

260
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,059
Are you

261
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,300
jealous?

262
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,660
Maybe, probably,

263
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
yes.

264
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,099
I'm so happy.

265
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:30,939
Are you all right?

266
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,140
Yes.

267
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:42,699
Great.

268
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,260
Zheng

269
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:52,699
Zheng

270
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,900
Zheng, wake up!

271
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,219
Zheng

272
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,380
Zheng, what's wrong with you?

273
00:13:58,819 --> 00:13:59,540
Zheng

274
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:00,780
Zheng

275
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,979
Zheng, how do you feel now?

276
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:09,579
Don't worry about me.

277
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,099
I'm fine.

278
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,180
Don't scare me.

279
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:14,780
I haven't heard

280
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,939
you say like me yet.

281
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,780
How can I be willing to die?

282
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,180
Lord

283
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,020
Lord Qu

284
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,459
How is he?

285
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,660
The poison did harm to the heart.

286
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,859
I'll have acupuncture on him

287
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,099
to protect the heart,

288
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,579
and force the poison out.

289
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,339
You,

290
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,059
fetch a basin of hot water.

291
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:16,219
Zheng

292
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:18,339
How are you feeling now?

293
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:20,540
Much better.

294
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:21,939
Don't worry.

295
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,900
I'll send some medicine later.

296
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,859
Remember to

297
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,459
let him take on time.

298
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,099
Thanks, Miss Su.

299
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:31,900
Keep in mind,

300
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:32,900
never channel the "qi"

301
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,620
before you recover.

302
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:35,699
Otherwise,

303
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:36,859
you'll be in danger.

304
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:38,780
Thank you, Miss Su.

305
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:39,739
Knock it off,

306
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:42,020
take good care of him.

307
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:46,859
Zheng

308
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,979
I'll be right outside,

309
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,979
call me if you need.

310
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,459
Miss Su

311
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:00,219
What's up?

312
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,699
I can't be more grateful

313
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,380
for your help.

314
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,660
You can say that again.

315
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,620
I always know

316
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,140
you are capable.

317
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,739
OK.

318
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,099
Consider it

319
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,180
Lord Qu and you

320
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
owe me one this time.

321
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:17,140
In the future,

322
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,540
I'll take it back.

323
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:20,099
That's easy.

324
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,219
But,

325
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,620
I have told Lord Yu of Valley

326
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,420
and Head Escort in private

327
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:25,699
about the poisoning.

328
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,699
Beyond that,

329
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,059
keep it a secret,

330
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,500
especially to the new couple.

331
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,300
Don't affect

332
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,500
their dinner party tomorrow night.

333
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,020
I see.

334
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:34,660
Take good care of him.

335
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,739
You,

336
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,979
I'll take good care of you too.

337
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:41,180
Do you want me to prick you?

338
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,140
Don't worry.

339
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:57,780
I'm fine.

340
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,059
Zheng

341
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:02,699
Ever since you met me,

342
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,260
I've been a burden on you.

343
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,699
I was like a big trouble.

344
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,380
There is nothing I can do.

345
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,540
You

346
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,859
just be my wife.

347
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,780
I'll do the rest.

348
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,339
Why do you like me?

349
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,739
Why would you

350
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,459
do so many things for me?

351
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,979
Because you are what you are.

352
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,979
Whatever your name is,

353
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,180
no matter you are a cook or someone.

354
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:39,900
As long as it's you,

355
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:42,020
I'll do anything

356
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,099
for you.

357
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:49,979
But there's nothing I can do.

358
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,699
There's only

359
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,059
one thing

360
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:54,939
I want you to do.

361
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,300
Don't leave me again.

362
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,660
When did I ever do?

363
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:05,140
Then promise me,

364
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,339
don't leave me ever.

365
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,260
Of course.

366
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,020
That's what you used to say.

367
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,339
Used to?

368
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,739
Zheng

369
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,459
Are you confused because of the illness?

370
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:19,739
I didn't say words

371
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,459
like that before.

372
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:23,459
Never mind.

373
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:24,459
I'm confused.

374
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:28,459
Baiwan

375
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,180
What did you bring

376
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,819
this morning?

377
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:35,660
Sesame dumplings in rice wine soup.

378
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:37,979
But you ignored me,

379
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,059
so I was mad and ate it.

380
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,020
It was you made

381
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:41,820
for me,

382
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:43,180
why did you eat it all?

383
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,779
What,

384
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,820
you wanna eat?

385
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,539
Well, then lie down,

386
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:49,539
I'll make it for you.

387
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,100
OK.

388
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:19,900
It's done.

389
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:20,939
Eat it while it's hot.

390
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,499
Zheng

391
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:43,580
I promise,

392
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:47,180
I'll never leave you.

393
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,699
But you have to promise me too.

394
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,539
Stop scaring me,

395
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,140
okay?

396
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,180
They were prepared for it.

397
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:13,380
You don't have to do anything here.

398
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,140
Take saussurea back,

399
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,180
the Host is more important.

400
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,100
OK.

401
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,939
Then should we

402
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,499
tell everything here to Host?

403
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,140
Truthfully report to him.

404
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,860
Yes, madam.

405
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,779
Young Master

406
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:30,420
Young Master

407
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:30,979
Young Master

408
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,939
There's something wrong!

409
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,739
There's something wrong!

410
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,499
I...

411
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,259
Why are you

412
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,979
in such a hurry?

413
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,499
The warehouse was stolen,

414
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,259
Lord of Valley gave an order

415
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,299
that check all the property

416
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:39,539
of the valley.

417
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:40,580
Get to the point.

418
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:42,299
What a surprise!

419
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:43,779
In Miss Jin's room.

420
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,060
There were plenty of suspicious objects.

421
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:46,739
Horrendous, exactly.

422
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,459
What on earth are those?

423
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,699
I'm, I'm too embarrassed to say it.

424
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,340
Jueming

425
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,259
Those are something about

426
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,739
hugging,

427
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,979
cuddling,

428
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,459
kissing and so on.

429
00:21:58,939 --> 00:21:59,779
What!

430
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:09,019
No,

431
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,219
it's wedding night.

432
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,140
I can't even fit into my wedding dress.

433
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,219
I can't eat any more.

434
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,699
But Mrs. Yu always

435
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,380
doesn't let me have enough food.

436
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:23,660
I have to eat when I'm hungry.

437
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,380
Eat it!

438
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:26,860
Miss Muqiu

439
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:30,180
It's you.

440
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,180
You scared me.

441
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:32,580
In order to prevent

442
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:33,620
thief stealing,

443
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,580
Young Master checked

444
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,299
your dowry chest.

445
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:37,620
All your novels

446
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:39,140
were found out.

447
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:40,340
What!

448
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:41,939
Miss Muqiu

449
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,779
Miss Muqiu

450
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:46,860
Jueming

451
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,380
Give my order,

452
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,860
what have been found

453
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,860
in Miss Muqiu's room

454
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,459
must not be told to anyone,

455
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:54,219
especially Mr and Mrs. Yu.

456
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,979
Yes.

457
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,259
Young Master

458
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:57,699
There are two more cases next door.

459
00:22:58,539 --> 00:22:59,060
Wha...

460
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,060
You,

461
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,860
what are you doing?

462
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,699
Jueming

463
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:06,259
Leave us alone.

464
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:07,259
OK.

465
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,259
Qiuer

466
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,060
Are these books

467
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,060
really yours?

468
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,539
If I say no,

469
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:20,380
will you believe me?

470
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:21,779
Then explain it to me,

471
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,499
why is there your handwriting

472
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:24,779
on these novels?

473
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,420
Why do you ask

474
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,939
if you know it?

475
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,820
How silly you are, Qiuer!

476
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:31,299
You are from a noble family.

477
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:32,180
How can you write,

478
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,539
write these

479
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,299
dirty novels?

480
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,019
What's wrong with my novels?

481
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,939
They're all

482
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,779
my hard work,

483
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,100
how can you degrade them?

484
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:43,779
Why can't you realize your fault?

485
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,299
Never mind.

486
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,539
I'll cover

487
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:48,739
what happened today for you.

488
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:49,699
But these things

489
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:50,860
can't be kept in the valley,

490
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,299
and known by anyone!

491
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:53,420
What are you going to do?

492
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,660
These are mine,

493
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,620
you can't take them away!

494
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,979
In this situation,

495
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,180
what do you want?

496
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,499
It makes people think

497
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:00,820
Young Mrs of Taoyuan Valley

498
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,259
is a person

499
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,299
who write disgusting and dirty books!

500
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:04,779
What will they think of us!

501
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,860
So many people like my novels,

502
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,979
why are they dirty

503
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,979
only

504
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,820
in Taoyuan Valley!

505
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:12,060
Well, what if I tell you,

506
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:14,060
you have to give up

507
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,380
those dirty things

508
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,580
if you want to marry me?

509
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:19,660
What do you mean?

510
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,100
Taoyuan Valley has strict rules,

511
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,660
these stuff can't be accepted.

512
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:24,699
If you want to calm things down today,

513
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,259
you must promise me.

514
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,539
From now on,

515
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:28,820
Never touch

516
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,219
and write these novels.

517
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,019
All that nonsense you did before

518
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,860
can not be

519
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,060
told to anyone!

520
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:37,420
You threaten me, don't you?

521
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:38,299
I didn't,

522
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,620
I just want you to think it through.

523
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,779
Young Mrs of Taoyuan Valley

524
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:45,499
is definitely not someone

525
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,979
who's amoral and unreasonable.

526
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,180
I won't back down

527
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,779
over the issue.

528
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:58,420
I can't believe you said that to me.

529
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,060
What I said is fact.

530
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:01,259
Do you think I want to get married to you

531
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,140
at Taoyuan Valley?

532
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,620
It's not possible for me

533
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:06,820
to give up the novels.

534
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,459
I won't marry you! Who cares!

535
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:08,979
You!

536
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:11,900
Nonsense!

537
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:13,219
The wedding day

538
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,140
is coming.

539
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:15,539
You are not going to marry him.

540
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:16,739
It's his fault!

541
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:17,299
You...

542
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,019
Sweetie,

543
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,779
What is going on?

544
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:20,660
Tell me,

545
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,180
I'm so worried about you.

546
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,699
Fenger

547
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,499
You go first.

548
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,259
Father, please,

549
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:32,140
please forgive me,

550
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,620
it's inconvenient to tell you.

551
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,259
You,

552
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,539
such a j*rk!

553
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,939
Mr Yu

554
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,900
What are you doing?

555
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,019
The warehouse was just stolen,

556
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:40,259
and there are many casualties.

557
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:41,420
Obviously,

558
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,699
there is someone targeting at us.

559
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,380
At this point in time,

560
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,100
you're so childish.

561
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:46,900
What is it?

562
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,380
It's my fault!

563
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:50,979
Don't worry,

564
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,660
the wedding will be on time.

565
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,459
And I will apologize to Miss Muqiu.

566
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,380
But I beg you,

567
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,219
allow us to settle this privately.

568
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,259
OK.

569
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,100
Mr Yu

570
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,140
Listen to him,

571
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,100
let them settle this.

572
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:05,299
Remember,

573
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:07,060
don't humiliate

574
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:08,539
Taoyuan Valley!

575
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:11,620
Calm down.

576
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Calm down.

577
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,180
Mr Yu

578
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:17,219
Mr Yu

579
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,140
Wait.

580
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:40,340
Are, are you all right?

581
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:45,299
Miss Muqiu

582
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:47,100
The engagement is of great importance.

583
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:49,140
What done is done.

584
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,580
Even if you don't want to marry me,

585
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,299
you have no choice.

586
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,459
It was you threatened me not to marry you.

587
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,219
I just want you

588
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,380
know your place.

589
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,820
Stop writing

590
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,939
those novels.

591
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,019
So you and I can

592
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:01,739
put all these behind us.

593
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:02,620
Let me stop writing

594
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,660
unless you kill me.

595
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,939
Kill you?

596
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,499
Under this situation,

597
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,580
do you want

598
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,459
the whole world knows it,

599
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,499
and both families are humiliated?

600
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,100
As long as you promise me

601
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:24,060
to get married.

602
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,060
I'll promise you,

603
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,420
I'll pretend I don't see

604
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,860
what you write,

605
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:29,900
even if you do something

606
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,779
out of line.

607
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:33,620
What do you mean?

608
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:37,420
As long as no one laugh at us,

609
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,820
I'll let you do whatever you want in private.

610
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,340
However,

611
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:44,939
the prestige of the Yu family

612
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,539
can not be ruined.

613
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,939
Wait,

614
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:52,140
in your opinion,

615
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,979
is the prestige of Taoyuan Valley

616
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,219
more important than anything else?

617
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,739
Including the marriage,

618
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:57,620
you marry me for

619
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,979
the prestige of Taoyuan Valley!

620
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:04,019
That's right.

621
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,380
This engagement

622
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,620
is about the prestige.

623
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,140
In my mind,

624
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,380
there's nothing more important

625
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,100
than that.

626
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:41,699
In your opinion,

627
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:43,620
is the prestige of Taoyuan Valley

628
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:44,860
more important than anything else?

629
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,380
Including the marriage,

630
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:47,140
you marry me for

631
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,380
the prestige of Taoyuan Valley!

632
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,259
That's right.

633
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:50,299
This engagement

634
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,580
is about the prestige.

635
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,820
In my mind,

636
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,539
there's nothing more important

637
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,219
than that.

638
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,060
Young Host

639
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,699
Gather all the disciples of Nonuple Palace

640
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:44,860
near Taoyuan Town.

641
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,699
Be there before the wedding tonight.

642
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,340
Yes.

643
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,180
But what happened in the valley?

644
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:51,060
I rarely see Young Host of Palace

645
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:51,979
be in such a hurry.

646
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,580
She'll be back soon.

647
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,140
Baiwan, what are you gonna do?

648
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:43,019
I have no idea

649
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,939
why I am on your bed.

650
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,420
But I definitely didn't mean to.

651
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,259
Baiwan

652
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,140
Today is Miss Muqiu's wedding day.

653
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,699
I almost forgot.

654
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,100
Right,

655
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:10,420
we can't miss

656
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,459
the big event.

657
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:14,779
You're right.

658
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,739
Now we should...

659
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,019
You should

660
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,860
get up now.

661
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:25,420
Otherwise

662
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,299
you wouldn't be able to get out the door.

663
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,299
What's wrong?

664
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:45,699
My heart pains.

665
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:48,499
I need a dose of medicine

666
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,979
to move on.

667
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
What kind of medicine?

668
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,820
Will you

669
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,939
give me?

670
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:04,499
I'm just kidding.
