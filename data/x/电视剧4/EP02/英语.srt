Fall in Love with a Fox EP02

3
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:41,726
Now, if there is

4
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,567
a dashing man

5
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:44,886
who is brave and resourceful

6
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:45,766
wants you to stay,

7
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,606
will you say yes to him, Miss?

8
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:58,366
Well, no.

9
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:02,846
Why?

10
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:05,967
Mr Qu

11
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,366
We've been fought together,

12
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:09,926
so we're friends, right?

13
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:12,646
It's my honor

14
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:13,966
to be Miss Jin's friend.

15
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,286
I mean

16
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,646
we'd better

17
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:19,926
avoid any confusion as friends.

18
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:29,007
What are you doing here?

19
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,487
I'm here to deliver a message to you, Miss.

20
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:33,367
The young master wants to meet both of you.

21
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:34,087
Right.

22
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:35,767
Look.

23
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:36,886
Why did she leave?

24
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:37,886
We should go, too.

25
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:38,326
Let's go.

26
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:47,007
There's something wrong in this house.

27
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,126
Actually, it's...

28
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:48,766
No.

29
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,447
There's something wrong with Yu Chen.

30
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,207
We just wanted to escape from the Mole Gang

31
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:54,526
as fast as we can,

32
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,126
and we had no time to think about

33
00:02:56,606 --> 00:02:57,886
the time that Mr. Yu showed up

34
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:59,447
was so coincident.

35
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:01,886
You're right.

36
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:03,207
He knew

37
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:04,647
I work for Jin's Escort Agency.

38
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:06,406
Maybe he's...

39
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,886
coming for the sacred book.

40
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,207
So...

41
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,046
We can't stay here.

42
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,606
I'm afraid it's not easy to leave here.

43
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:16,007
Don't worry, Miss.

44
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,807
Since you consider me as your friend,

45
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,486
I will protect you

46
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,326
no matter what happens.

47
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:24,007
You hired me as your escort

48
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:24,927
before, right?

49
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:25,927
But why do you want to

50
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:26,847
protect me now?

51
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,606
And you know nothing about kong fu.

52
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:29,567
How can you...

53
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:32,606
Although I don't know kong fu,

54
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:34,647
I'll find a way

55
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:35,966
to protect you.

56
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:39,486
Okay.

57
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:41,807
Leave here?

58
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:42,647
Yeah.

59
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:44,326
Thanks for your help this time.

60
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:45,247
Mr. Yu

61
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:46,366
It's just that...

62
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:47,486
Miss Jin and I

63
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:48,527
have something to deal with right now,

64
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:49,926
so we must leave.

65
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:50,926
No.

66
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:51,967
How can Miss Jin

67
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,127
want to leave?

68
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,886
I just found something.

69
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:58,086
What did you find?

70
00:03:58,247 --> 00:03:59,967
I helped you

71
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,007
in a such cool way.

72
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:02,326
I'm afraid it already

73
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:03,167
made a lasting impression

74
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,007
on you.

75
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,447
Don't be shy, Miss.

76
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:08,646
If you

77
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:09,646
stay here,

78
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,326
I will keep you safe.

79
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,847
As the young master of Yu's family,

80
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:15,646
how can you force the people

81
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:16,806
from Jin's Escort Agency to stay here?

82
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,247
You misunderstood me, Miss.

83
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,646
If you can stay in my house,

84
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,247
I will keep you safe.

85
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,127
As for him...

86
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:25,926
He can leave now.

87
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:27,567
Mr. Qu

88
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:28,687
Just help yourself.

89
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:32,527
You misunderstood, Mr. Yu.

90
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:34,287
Since you

91
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:35,447
have a crush on Miss Jin,

92
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,527
wanting her to stay here for a few days more,

93
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:38,486
then I

94
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,687
will comply your request.

95
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:42,407
What?

96
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:48,326
No, no, no.

97
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:49,527
You guys

98
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:50,687
held a wedding ceremony in Mole Gang.

99
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:52,967
How can you let her

100
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:53,967
stay here like that?

101
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,527
How did you know that?

102
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:56,806
I...

103
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:58,806
I heard of it.

104
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,287
Don't worry, Mr. Yu.

105
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:02,366
What Miss Jin and I did

106
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,287
was to fool

107
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:04,567
the leader of Mole Gang.

108
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:05,766
Besides,

109
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,567
Miss Jin once said that

110
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,206
we had no other option at that time.

111
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:10,646
Just let it go.

112
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:12,007
What're you talking about?

113
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,206
I thought you were my friend.

114
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:14,167
Good.

115
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:16,926
I believe Mr. Yu is a magnanimous person,

116
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:17,646
so you

117
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:18,847
will let that pass, right?

118
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:19,646
Me?

119
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:22,086
Of course, I will let it go.

120
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:23,527
That's great.

121
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:24,646
Tomorrow morning,

122
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:26,046
I will say a proper farewell

123
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,366
to you two.

124
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:32,527
Young master

125
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:37,967
Don't you remember

126
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:38,567
what you said just now?

127
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:39,687
What did I say?

128
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:41,007
We had a deal that...

129
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:41,806
What's the deal?

130
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,366
There is no sacred book in the bag.

131
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:47,967
Well, tomorrow morning

132
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:49,167
we will send Mr. Qu off,

133
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:50,486
so I will leave you to talk.

134
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,366
I have something important to deal with.

135
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:54,246
Wait! I...

136
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:57,887
You can't go.

137
00:05:58,246 --> 00:05:58,686
Come here.

138
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:01,287
You tell me exactly

139
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:02,246
what you mean?

140
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,486
If Miss Jin keeps

141
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:05,967
badgering me like this here,

142
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,126
it will be inappropriate.

143
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:08,446
Badgering you?

144
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:10,207
I would not have thought that

145
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,446
you were an ingrate and traitor.

146
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,246
At stake,

147
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:14,926
I have to

148
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:15,686
keep myself safe first.

149
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:17,566
You should only blame yourself

150
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:18,926
for being so trusting.

151
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:19,806
You...

152
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:20,887
After all,

153
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:22,446
it seems that

154
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:23,767
you lack life experience.

155
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,327
Don't worry, Miss.

156
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,806
Everything's for a reason.

157
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,606
The young master told me

158
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,046
Miss Jin has been bustled about for one day,

159
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:31,887
so you'd better bathe and dress.

160
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:33,686
Bathe?

161
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,606
Lord Xueyue, I have news to report.

162
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:38,126
The escorts took the sacred book

163
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:39,207
to Yu's house.

164
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,686
It doesn't matter if she dies.

165
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,006
What matters is

166
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:48,246
to figure out

167
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,566
if the sacred book is authentic.

168
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:50,246
Got it.

169
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:52,686
You must do it quietly and carefully.

170
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:54,527
If there is anyone that

171
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:55,926
knows Nonuple Palace

172
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,006
get involved in it,

173
00:06:58,327 --> 00:06:59,767
we're all gonna die.

174
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:00,926
Got it, my lord.

175
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:07,327
Miss Jin

176
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:09,486
We have been tracking

177
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,207
along the escorting route,

178
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:11,246
so I believe we will

179
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:12,407
find something about Miss Baiwan soon.

180
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:13,806
Really?

181
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:14,926
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

182
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:18,287
Miss Jin

183
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,087
What're you writing?

184
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:21,527
Nothing.

185
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,486
I just copy

186
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,366
some books by sages.

187
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,606
That's cool.

188
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:28,767
Thank you.

189
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,566
Each time I finish my needlework,

190
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:31,806
I copy some words from books

191
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:33,046
to self-reflect.

192
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:33,926
That's great.

193
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:35,327
As an ancient saying goes,

194
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:36,647
"Every day I examine myself on three counts."

195
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:37,686
I admire Miss Jin

196
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:38,686
for keep doing that every day.

197
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,686
You're the one that I should learn from.

198
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:41,847
So...

199
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,126
Mr. Yu

200
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:44,967
You can go on.

201
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,527
I will go to meet my father.

202
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:47,287
Bye.

203
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:50,167
Watch out!

204
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:52,527
Are you alright?

205
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:54,686
Yeah.

206
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:56,246
Stop!

207
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:58,126
What happened?

208
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,686
I can do it myself.

209
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,006
It's okay. Let me help you.

210
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,006
I said no!

211
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:07,967
Are you okay, Mr. Yu?

212
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:10,006
I didn't mean it.

213
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:11,647
Let me bind it up.

214
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,046
I'm okay, Miss Jin.

215
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:13,967
Well,

216
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:14,647
I'm going to ask someone else

217
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:15,287
to pick it up for you.

218
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:15,847
It doesn't matter.

219
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:16,806
Your scratch is more important.

220
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:18,207
Well...

221
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:28,407
Qiuer

222
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:29,486
What're you looking for?

223
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:30,686
I'm looking for some medicine for Mr. Yu.

224
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:32,606
Is he sick?

225
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:33,647
No.

226
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:35,167
It's my fault.

227
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,647
I hurt him.

228
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,767
Did you guys get into a fight?

229
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,087
Are you badly hurt?

230
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:40,446
-No  -Let me have a check.

231
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:42,087
His hands got hurt.

232
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:43,967
There are bruises on them.

233
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:46,246
Oh, my daughter,

234
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:47,727
stop searching it.

235
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,727
That's a precious gift

236
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:51,006
for your future father-in-law.

237
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:51,967
Besides,

238
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,087
it won't work for

239
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,407
the bruises on hands.

240
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,327
How about that?

241
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:58,926
That's the Medication for Wound Infection

242
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,806
passing down from our family.

243
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,967
That is more precious than

244
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,767
Taoyuan Valley's Yulu Pill.

245
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:06,287
Whatever.

246
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,006
Just let him pick himself.

247
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,046
Qiuer

248
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,087
Qiuer

249
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,847
She hasn't got married with him,

250
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,366
but she has been so nice to him.

251
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,446
Kids all get to grow up one day.

252
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:17,566
Miss Jin

253
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,527
Is it serious?

254
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:22,727
Don't worry, Miss Jin.

255
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,967
The wound is so long.

256
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:26,366
It must be pretty bad.

257
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:28,806
Thank you.

258
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:37,647
Trust me.

259
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:38,967
These are superior medications.

260
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:39,887
I got that from my dad

261
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:40,647
for you.

262
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:47,727
What...

263
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:52,887
Young master

264
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:53,527
Sorry. I'm sorry.

265
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:53,887
Sorry.

266
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:54,847
Sorry.

267
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:12,647
Miss Jin

268
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:14,846
Don't trouble yourself.

269
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:17,647
Well, I'm going to take a new one for you.

270
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:19,566
Miss...

271
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:20,926
Young master

272
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,367
Didn't you say that

273
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:23,806
you don't love her?

274
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,926
Why you're so nice to her?

275
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,206
We can't see our engagement as a child's play.

276
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:28,966
Somehow,

277
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
I have to marry her

278
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,127
for Taoyuan Valley's sake.

279
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,167
You will marry her though you don't love her.

280
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,527
What will you do with it later?

281
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,607
I believe

282
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,527
we can be a good couple

283
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,407
if we treat each other with love and respect.

284
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:46,167
Miss Jin is coming.

285
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,686
I'm back with the medication.

286
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,046
Miss, please.

287
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,007
Leave me alone.

288
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,247
Why did they follow my instruction?

289
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:15,446
No.

290
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,046
There must be someone else here.

291
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:25,566
The reason why Yu Chen asked me to get a bath

292
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:26,887
is to get

293
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:28,167
the sacred book.

294
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:30,966
Don't worry, Miss.

295
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:32,446
Everything's for a reason.

296
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:35,086
So does that mean...

297
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:36,846
he has other ideas.

298
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,407
Why do I think of him now?

299
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,686
The sacred book will be mine.

300
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:43,247
You're so smart, young master.

301
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:51,887
Miss Jin

302
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,726
The sacred book has been

303
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:54,726
thrown out of the wall

304
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:56,046
as you ordered me.

305
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,767
We can get it back

306
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,007
after escaping

307
00:11:59,046 --> 00:11:59,686
from here tomorrow.

308
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:00,407
Good job.

309
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:02,607
No one knows that

310
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:03,566
we had thrown the book

311
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:04,527
out of there.

312
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:06,686
Don't freeze!

313
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:07,367
Go find it!

314
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,167
They've gone.

315
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,046
Have you found it?

316
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:25,887
There's nothing, young master.

317
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:26,767
Master

318
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,007
Jin Baiwan has escaped!

319
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:28,647
What?

320
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:30,326
We're fooled! Move it!

321
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:31,607
Okay, okay.

322
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:31,966
Go!

323
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:34,726
It's beautiful.

324
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,607
Look at those staffs.

325
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:38,686
Have a look, sir.

326
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,167
Come in, sir.

327
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:41,326
This way, this way.

328
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:43,686
Come on. Come on.

329
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:47,287
On my god.

330
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,167
This...

331
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:49,926
There!

332
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:50,926
Go!

333
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:52,846
What're you doing?

334
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,046
It's crowded here.

335
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:55,287
If you rush everywhere,

336
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:56,487
you'll be easy to spot.

337
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:57,726
What can we do now?

338
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:59,287
They're over there.

339
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:00,607
We can watch the lantern shows

340
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,007
with others.

341
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,527
Watching the lantern shows?

342
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,367
What're you doing?

343
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:10,806
To cover up.

344
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,247
Sorry for my offence.

345
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,007
What is she doing here?

346
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:32,127
It's impossible.

347
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:43,607
Goodbye, sir.

348
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:44,487
Come again.

349
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:52,247
A mask?

350
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:53,607
Taking that,

351
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,046
it will be more difficult for them to find us.

352
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:51,127
Have we met

353
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:52,046
somewhere before?

354
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,046
They're over there!

355
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:07,446
Move!

356
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:08,767
I don't want to be a burden to you anymore!

357
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:09,966
Leave!

358
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:21,806
I have punished the rascals

359
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:24,046
that offended you, Miss.

360
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:35,287
I'm Xu Yifei.

361
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:37,926
It's nice to meet you.

362
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,046
My I know your name, Miss?

363
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:47,206
Stop!

364
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:47,846
Freeze!

365
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,007
You wanna run away?

366
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:53,647
No way!

367
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:54,926
Yu Chen, the young master of Yu's family,

368
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:56,326
wants to kidnap a girl here.

369
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:58,046
Help me!

370
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,046
Shut up!

371
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:02,206
You, you little girl

372
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:02,686
damaged

373
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:03,686
my reputation.

374
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,086
Why don't you self-reflect?

375
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,007
Why did Qu

376
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:06,926
abandon you?

377
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:10,007
Mr. Yu

378
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:13,247
Although your family is so rich,

379
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:15,607
but you have venereal disease,

380
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,686
the worst one.

381
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:20,686
How can I marry you?

382
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:24,287
I don't have any venereal disease.

383
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:25,407
I don't have any venereal disease.

384
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:26,926
I don't have any venereal disease.

385
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,487
I'm so healthy!

386
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:29,607
You! Move!

387
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:30,647
Go!

388
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:38,247
Get her back!

389
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:39,086
Rise!

390
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:39,806
Go!

391
00:16:57,686 --> 00:16:58,167
Stop!

392
00:16:58,287 --> 00:16:59,487
Here she is! Here she is!

393
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,527
You want the sacred book, right?

394
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:01,086
Yeah. The sacred book.

395
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:01,686
I won't give it to you

396
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,487
even though I rip it into pieces.

397
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:04,487
Pick it up!

398
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,167
Screw you!

399
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:05,846
You two

400
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:06,566
get her down!

401
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:07,167
Go!

402
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:07,566
Okay.

403
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,167
Freeze!

404
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:08,926
You! Get down!

405
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,367
You want that, right?

406
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:29,767
Are you okay?

407
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:33,527
Let's go.

408
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,926
Where're you going?

409
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:44,527
I see. You collude with each other.

410
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:45,247
Little girl

411
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,527
You know it until now?

412
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:53,167
He's so weak?

413
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:54,647
Go, go, go.

414
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:55,487
Come on.

415
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:56,287
Go.

416
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:57,407
Stop!

417
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:58,527
Freeze!

418
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:16,726
Okay.

419
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:29,487
Get all the pieces back!

420
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:30,806
Am I clear?

421
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:31,607
Yes, sir.

422
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:32,926
Go have a check there!

423
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:34,566
How's it going?

424
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:36,686
These are the pieces of the sacred book.

425
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:38,566
Okay. Let me have a look.

426
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:43,607
The Romance of Flower Rain and Swordsman.

427
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:46,966
A Collector's Edition with Qiu qiuer's Signal.

428
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:48,647
It may be a fake one.

429
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:49,847
I know!

430
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:50,847
You must get her back

431
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:51,807
for me today!

432
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:53,206
I must cut her body into pieces!

433
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:53,847
Let's go!

434
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,807
How can she go out with such an ugly face?

435
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:11,486
Is she ugly?

436
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:12,647
Yeah.

437
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:13,847
Move!

438
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,327
Lord

439
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:19,766
The escort ran away anyway.

440
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,486
The Guqin player with her

441
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:22,726
is not a normal person.

442
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,167
He doesn't matter.

443
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:26,167
What matters is that you must

444
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:27,047
find the escort.

445
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:29,206
But the Majesty told us

446
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,206
to make it clear

447
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:31,486
whether the sacred book is authentic, right?

448
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:32,847
Are you questioning my orders?

449
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:33,807
No. I'm sorry.

450
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,246
Here's what you should know.

451
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:36,966
You must

452
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,167
find the escort for me

453
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:40,206
at any cost.

454
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:40,847
Yes, my lord.

455
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:03,407
Don't worry, Miss.

456
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:05,006
We're out of the town for miles.

457
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:13,647
Finally.

458
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:16,006
Thank you so much, Mr. Qu.

459
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:17,486
You saved me one more time.

460
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:19,367
It's so flattering, Miss.

461
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:21,006
It's my honor

462
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,607
to go through something with you.

463
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,127
But you don't know kong fu.

464
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:27,526
Weren't you afraid that you would be in danger

465
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,726
when you came for me?

466
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:31,047
I can't be a traitor

467
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:34,206
or an ingrate

468
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:35,766
whether I know kong fu or not, right?

469
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:38,686
And I promised you that

470
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:39,607
I would keep you safe,

471
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,766
so I must keep it.

472
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,206
Come on.

473
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:49,966
Here we are.

474
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:53,006
You saved me again this time,

475
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:53,887
so you're a friend of

476
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:55,006
Jin's Escort Agency.

477
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:56,327
I'll protect you in the future.

478
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:02,246
What're you doing?

479
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:07,407
She is...

480
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:09,206
She's my cousin, Su Zhuozhuo.

481
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,926
Thanks to her,

482
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,127
we can escape from there.

483
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,127
Oh, she's your cousin. I see.

484
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:18,127
I'll treat your cousin

485
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:19,246
as my cousin.

486
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,367
Who's your cousin?

487
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:21,327
Although Qu...

488
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:24,647
my cousin saved you,

489
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,206
don't expect that you can get along with him

490
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:27,246
in a causal way.

491
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:28,006
Get off.

492
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,127
You can get off now, my cousin.

493
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:32,246
Be careful.

494
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:43,966
She is so wild.

495
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:50,847
So,

496
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:52,567
except for Yu Chen,

497
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:54,567
those crowds of gang members

498
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:55,766
headed for

499
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,726
the goods escorted by you.

500
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,686
If you insist on

501
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:00,087
escorting the goods,

502
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:01,286
the way you go

503
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:02,807
will be more dangerous.

504
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,206
Jin's Escort Agency never lose the goods.

505
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:06,647
I must deliver the sacred book to my client

506
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,206
though it is difficult.

507
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:09,286
So...

508
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:11,286
Will you deliver it by yourself?

509
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:12,647
Well...

510
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:18,766
So where will you go,

511
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:20,486
Mr. Qu and cousin?

512
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:23,526
In fact, I'm meant to

513
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:25,446
find a people this time.

514
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:26,526
Find a people?

515
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:28,047
I had received the news that

516
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,327
the person would head to Tongzhou.

517
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,686
Tongzhou?

518
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:34,367
So we're on the same path!

519
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,327
Really?

520
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,206
Well, then,

521
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:38,847
how about going there together?

522
00:22:39,246 --> 00:22:40,367
And we can help each other.

523
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:40,966
Okay.

524
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:41,807
Cousin

525
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:43,726
Are you sure we have to go there together?

526
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:46,127
It's inconvenient for Miss Jin

527
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:47,567
to take us together.

528
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:49,766
You're right.

529
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:52,246
We're not in the same world.

530
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:54,246
If you go there with us,

531
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,486
we'll be a burden to you.

532
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:56,567
No, no.

533
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:58,206
The more, the merrier.

534
00:22:58,486 --> 00:22:59,486
It's settled, then.

535
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:03,246
It's settled, then.

536
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:04,887
You've been bustled about for the whole night,

537
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:06,006
so you must be hungry, right?

538
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:07,647
Let me cook you a meal.

539
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:09,407
Wow, you can cook.

540
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,686
I'm the best chief of

541
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:13,887
Jin's Escort Agency.

542
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:26,567
Have a taste.

543
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:28,847
It looks not bad.

544
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:29,807
Of course.

545
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:39,686
You don't know what the delicious food is.

546
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:51,766
Well, try it.

547
00:23:58,807 --> 00:23:59,367
Nice.

548
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:01,167
I knew it.

549
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:02,607
Mr. Qu must be the one

550
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:03,887
that can enjoy my meal.

551
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:05,726
What the meal?

552
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,446
It's too spicy and salty.

553
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:08,486
Why do you take

554
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,006
so many peppers with you when going out?

555
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:11,446
How to have a meal

556
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:12,766
without peppers?

557
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:16,006
It's said Jinbian Town's people like peppers.

558
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:17,887
So that's true.

559
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:20,486
By the way,

560
00:24:21,446 --> 00:24:22,327
I've been meaning to ask,

561
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:23,966
did you grow up

562
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,807
in Jin's Escort Agency?

563
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:27,567
Yeah.

564
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,087
I grew up in the agency,

565
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:30,407
so I began to eat spicy food when I was young.

566
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:31,726
Haven't you ever left

567
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,047
Jin's Escort Agency?

568
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:36,006
Of course no.

569
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:40,926
Since you like

570
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:41,526
my soup so much,

571
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:42,847
let me take another bowl for you.

572
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,966
No. Stop.

573
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,167
If my cousin get sick because of

574
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:46,766
your soup,

575
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:47,966
you can't take the responsibility for that.

576
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:49,926
Cousin

577
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:51,847
Don't take the soup, please.

578
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:53,127
Go to sleep early.

579
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,206
We'll have a long way to go tomorrow.

580
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:01,446
What will you do

581
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:04,367
if I disappear some day?

582
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:12,167
I will

583
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:15,246
find you

584
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:16,926
wherever you're,

585
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:19,006
either in the heaven or hell.

586
00:25:31,006 --> 00:25:32,486
Why didn't you show up

587
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:34,206
after three days?

588
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:39,766
Who is he?

589
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:42,246
Why did he keep asking about my background?

590
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,206
Does he really know nothing about kong fu?

591
00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:59,087
The spicy dried meat from Fuyun Restaurant.

592
00:25:59,446 --> 00:26:00,087
Don't you have a try?

593
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,407
You know

594
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:02,286
I never eat spicy food.

595
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:05,966
But you took the meal

596
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:06,766
cooked by Miss Jin,

597
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:08,847
and you enjoyed it.

598
00:26:12,526 --> 00:26:13,087
How's going on?

599
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,127
Is she the one?

600
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:17,167
She didn't like peppers before,

601
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:18,926
so I can't make sure about it now.

602
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:20,167
How about you?

603
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:21,446
How's the investigation going?

604
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:23,286
There were two people with masks

605
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:24,446
on the lanterns show.

606
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,327
I can't figure out which school they're from.

607
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:27,926
The leader of them is so powerful.

608
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,167
I nearly got caught

609
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:30,047
when I stalked them.

610
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:31,887
So I had to give up.

611
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:33,047
It doesn't matter.

612
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:34,446
Since they

613
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,486
headed for the sacred book,

614
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:37,286
they will show up again.

615
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:40,047
So...

616
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:42,766
You have to make up your mind quickly.

617
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:44,607
I'll try to figure it out

618
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,167
whether she is the one

619
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,286
I want to find.

620
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:25,847
You've glanced at me for many times

621
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:27,486
in one hour.

622
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:28,847
What happened, Miss?

623
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:30,926
If he knows something about kong fu,

624
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,047
I will know it by his hands.

625
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:36,486
I just feel

626
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:37,567
it's boring.

627
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,167
I want to play a game with you.

628
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:40,966
You can just speak it out.

629
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,446
I want to read your palms.

630
00:27:43,647 --> 00:27:44,367
Read palms?

631
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:45,966
But I wonder

632
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,286
if you can trust me.

633
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:49,887
I believe all the words

634
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:51,567
you speak.

635
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:56,246
Excuse me.

636
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:02,726
There are so many calluses on his hands.

637
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,127
How can I know

638
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,726
if he practices kong fu?

639
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,726
Have you got something, Miss?

640
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:16,486
Of course.

641
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:17,526
But I wonder

642
00:28:17,726 --> 00:28:18,647
what you want to know.

643
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:23,486
It must be something about my love.

644
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:24,726
Your love?

645
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:28,847
There are so many sets in finding your love.

646
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:29,966
Why?

647
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:31,926
It's not precise

648
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,407
only by reading your palms.

649
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,766
Do you know something about reading bones?

650
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,127
So you also master that skill, Miss?

651
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:40,087
I only know a little.

652
00:28:40,526 --> 00:28:42,047
But I can know

653
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:43,766
all the secrets

654
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:45,006
that the one has.

655
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:46,966
Go ahead, Miss.

656
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:51,966
The bones of the one who practices kongfu is special.

657
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:53,766
Will I know it

658
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:54,926
at such degree?

659
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:10,966
What're you doing, Jin Baiwan?

660
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:12,127
I knew it.

661
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:13,286
I knew why you

662
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:13,926
asked things about him.

663
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,607
You have a crush on my cousin.

664
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:17,446
No.

665
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:18,446
Yes.

666
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:34,206
We can't see our engagement as a child's play.

667
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:35,246
Somehow,

668
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,847
I have to marry her

669
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:38,327
for Taoyuan Valley's sake.

670
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:40,807
It's not about the engagement.

671
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:43,246
He doesn't love me actually.

672
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:47,926
Miss...

673
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:51,926
Miss Jin

674
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:55,286
May I call your

675
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,567
given name in the future?

676
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:02,127
Miss Muqiu

677
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:04,847
What happened?

678
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:09,686
The fruit is for you

679
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:10,766
to quench your thirst.

680
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,486
You got it by yourself?

681
00:30:16,926 --> 00:30:17,446
Yeah.

682
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:19,446
Young master

683
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:20,847
Young master

684
00:30:21,206 --> 00:30:22,047
What you ordered

685
00:30:22,127 --> 00:30:22,766
are all prepared.

686
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:23,686
You can have a check.

687
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:24,567
Okay.

688
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:26,966
Miss Muqiu

689
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,446
I will leave first.

690
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,407
He picked some fruit for me,

691
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,807
so it means

692
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,766
he kind of loves me.

693
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,926
The fruits picked by young master are sweet.

694
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:53,726
He's so nice.

695
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:56,446
I...

696
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:02,567
It's not sweet.

697
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:06,407
You haven't found her?

698
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:07,686
Jin Baiwan...

699
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:09,006
She disappeared

700
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:10,486
after the lanterns show.

701
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:11,486
There must be someone

702
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:12,567
helping her to hide the track.

703
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:17,286
But I've found something else.

704
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:18,966
I found

705
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,006
the sacred book

706
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:21,407
is for a person

707
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:22,847
named Qing Songke.

708
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:24,367
Qing Songke...

709
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:26,567
Do you know

710
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:27,726
the school he belongs to?

711
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,686
I'm on it, my lord.

712
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:36,686
I will go back to the palace

713
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:37,807
and report it to the Lord.

714
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:40,087
You must find the escort

715
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:41,446
as soon as possible.

716
00:31:41,686 --> 00:31:42,686
Don't let anyone else get

717
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:43,847
the sacred book.

718
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:45,127
Got it, my lord.

719
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:47,087
On the lanterns show, you said that

720
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:47,926
you might meet me before.

721
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:48,847
May I know

722
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:51,966
where did we meet?

723
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,206
I got it!

724
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:01,887
You got it?

725
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:04,327
You played the Guqin in Jin's Escort Agency

726
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:06,407
on the Huazhao Conference three years ago.

727
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:07,367
You were

728
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:08,847
the Guqin Player in blue dress, right?

729
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:14,647
Did I say something wrong?

730
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:19,486
Miss Jin

731
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:22,087
Did you really grow up

732
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:22,847
in the escort agency?

733
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:29,647
Miss Qu

734
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:30,966
Are you alright?

735
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:33,006
-What happened?  -What to do now?

736
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:33,567
Step aside.

737
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:45,327
Does it hurt?

738
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:47,327
No.

739
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,926
Fortunately, that's not a venomous snake.

740
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,006
I just

741
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,486
left to get some fruits.

742
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:54,686
Then she put you in such a position.

743
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:56,647
It's because of my carelessness.

744
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:57,766
It's not her fault.

745
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,607
Why are you on her side now?

746
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:02,726
You've been nice to her along the journey,

747
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:05,006
but you didn't treat me like that.

748
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:08,847
Miss Jin is pure and simple.

749
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:10,167
Miss Su

750
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:11,446
Don't be hostile to her.

751
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:12,966
Did I?

752
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:18,246
I'm going to find

753
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:19,607
some herbs for you.

754
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:37,367
Does that hurt?

755
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:39,047
It hurts.

756
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:42,647
I'm sorry.

757
00:33:43,446 --> 00:33:44,206
It happened suddenly.

758
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:45,206
It's not your fault.

759
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,087
Mr Qu

760
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,567
You've been helping me along the journey,

761
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:52,807
however, I not only put you in such a position

762
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,567
but also lied to you.

763
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,367
What does that mean?

764
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:01,486
I didn't tell you the truth

765
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,446
when you asked me about my experience.

766
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,286
In facts, I was took to Jin's Escort Agency

767
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:08,486
five years ago.

768
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:09,647
Five years ago?

769
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:13,087
I lost all the memories

770
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,127
before that.

771
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:17,286
But my young female master told me that

772
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:18,647
I couldn't tell my experience

773
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:19,327
to anyone.

774
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:20,807
So I lied

775
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:21,847
to you.

776
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:25,087
I have nothing to

777
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,567
pay your debt of gratitude.

778
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:27,807
But I have a pendant.

779
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:29,607
Although it's valueless,

780
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:30,966
I've been wearing it all the time.

781
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:32,887
I can give it to you

782
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:33,607
if you don't mind.
