Fall in Love with a Fox EP10

3
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,579
It stinks.

4
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,899
Reek of alcohol.

5
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,300
Where's Baiwan?

6
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,500
If I tell you

7
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,299
that I'm not

8
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,899
from a noble family,

9
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,100
will you still love me?

10
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,499
Young Master

11
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:55,539
Master and Madam

12
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:56,300
asked you to meet them.

13
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:58,660
Ok, I see.

14
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,660
Well,

15
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:01,499
well,

16
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,699
Miss Jin woke up.

17
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,539
But after she woke up,

18
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:06,419
she went to

19
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:07,740
Lord Qu of Tingqin Garden.

20
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:09,740
That's inappropriate!

21
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:10,860
You have to find her.

22
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,100
Ok, I'm going.

23
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:07,980
Why are you here?

24
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,420
It's my bedroom.

25
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,619
And the bed in which you slept

26
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,219
is also mine.

27
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,659
If I'm not here,

28
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,099
where should I go?

29
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:17,499
Well,

30
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,899
why am I here?

31
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
About what happened yesterday,

32
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,659
did you forget it totally?

33
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:23,980
Yesterday...

34
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,659
You also forgot what you said

35
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,140
yesterday?

36
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,059
What did I say?

37
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Well...

38
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:51,740
Stop,

39
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:54,499
I don't want to know it.

40
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:55,860
I have a headache.

41
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:57,140
I can't remember anything.

42
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,499
As the old saying goes,

43
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,260
in wine there is truth.

44
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,540
When you were drunk,

45
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,860
you kept telling me how much you love me.

46
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:05,460
And you said

47
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:07,619
that you wanted to marry me as soon as possible,

48
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:12,099
have nine kids with me,

49
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,980
and live in harmony and happiness.

50
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,540
Don't talk nonsense.

51
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,059
I couldn't have said that.

52
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:20,260
Ok, you're right.

53
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,219
You cunning fox, don't lie to me.

54
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,460
But I did ask you yesterday

55
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,580
that you liked me or not.

56
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:29,420
You...

57
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,379
What did I say?

58
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,540
What do

59
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,460
you think?

60
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,499
There should be a lot of answers.

61
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,819
I don't know what I said.

62
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:40,819
It's ok.

63
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,899
I heard what I wanted to hear.

64
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Qu Zheng, what's wrong with you?

65
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,819
Did you sexually assault her

66
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,619
when she was drunk?

67
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,059
No, he didn't.

68
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,300
He didn't?

69
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,220
Were you really such a gentleman?

70
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,900
She was drunk,

71
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,860
and you did nothing?

72
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,819
Were you so gentle?

73
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,059
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:03,699
It's not ok if you didn't sexually assault her.

75
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,579
So you mean

76
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,980
that I should do something to Baiwan?

77
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,740
No, of course not.

78
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,900
Since you didn't sexually assault her,

79
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,980
then why did you bring her here?

80
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,459
The womenfolk gathering yesterday

81
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,579
caused an uproar.

82
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,819
After Mrs. Yu woke up

83
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
and found herself out of control,

84
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,059
she cried and said she was going to hang herself.

85
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,059
I was afraid

86
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,540
that Lord Yu would blame Baiwan,

87
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,699
so I made decisions without seeking approval.

88
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,660
Oh my god,

89
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,180
I'll be toast this time.

90
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,780
Relax, you'll be fine.

91
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:32,740
It's not that terrible.

92
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,579
Miss Jin

93
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,180
Miss Jin

94
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:37,420
Miss Jin

95
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:38,499
You're really here.

96
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:39,499
I'm not. I'm not.

97
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:42,740
So early in the morning,

98
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,740
you met other men.

99
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:45,379
Really?

100
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:46,819
Oh,

101
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,059
Young Master asked

102
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:48,900
you

103
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,100
to go to the main hall.

104
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:51,980
Main hall?

105
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:53,259
Taoyuan Valley

106
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,540
pays the most attention to etiquette,

107
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,860
but this time

108
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:58,300
we lost all the dignity in front of everyone.

109
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,619
Mrs. Yu

110
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,220
I didn't provide great education to my daughter.

111
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:02,499
It's all my fault.

112
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:04,379
Darling

113
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:05,180
Calm down.

114
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,180
Mr Jin

115
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:08,259
Please rest assured.

116
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:09,300
The women

117
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,540
were comforted mostly.

118
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:11,499
It

119
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:12,459
won't influence

120
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,499
the wedding between our offspring.

121
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,180
As for Miss Jin...

122
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,699
Punish.

123
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:17,900
We have to punish her.

124
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:19,660
Since it's Qiuer's fault,

125
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:20,740
we have to punish her.

126
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:21,579
Qiuer

127
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:22,939
Take the blame.

128
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,379
It's my fault.

129
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,220
Sorry, I'll take the blame.

130
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,180
Sorry,

131
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,619
it's my bad, too.

132
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:31,819
Fenger

133
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,220
Are you crazy?

134
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:34,059
On my way here

135
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,499
Miss Muqiu told me

136
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:36,499
that she couldn't drink.

137
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,619
I didn't tell you this in time,

138
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,939
so the terrible thing happened.

139
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:41,100
Well, well,

140
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,619
good boy.

141
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,059
You... well... I...

142
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,139
Mr Jin

143
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,379
No, it's not your fault.

144
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,699
I'm Miss Muqiu's fiancÃ©.

145
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,579
I couldn't warn her in the womenfolk gathering.

146
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,699
It's my bad.

147
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,900
Brother Shu

148
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,420
I'm willing to take the rap for her,

149
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,660
and volunteer to copy family rules

150
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,660
as a punishment.

151
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:19,900
Who?

152
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
It's me.

153
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,180
It's my fault.

154
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,220
I'm sorry that you took the blame for me.

155
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,980
I should copy it.

156
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,499
I volunteered to take this blame.

157
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,459
I should do this myself.

158
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,420
Brother Shu

159
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,259
Are you mad at me?

160
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,499
I promise

161
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:41,100
that I won't drink anymore.

162
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:42,100
Miss Muqiu

163
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,259
You should go back and have an early rest.

164
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,220
I'm not tired.

165
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,379
You must be exhausted.

166
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:52,379
There's no one here.

167
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,540
You don't need to kneel.

168
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,300
I'm the Young Master of Taoyuan Valley.

169
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,220
I won't play a double game.

170
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:58,340
There are so many rules

171
00:08:58,459 --> 00:08:59,459
in your Taoyuan Valley.

172
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:00,740
It's too much pressure.

173
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,139
You should abolish them all.

174
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:03,860
Abolish?

175
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,860
Did I say something wrong?

176
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:16,139
All right,

177
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,900
you'll

178
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,780
figure it out sooner or later.

179
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,740
Do you know

180
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,619
how we

181
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:29,860
made such great achievements in Taoyuan Valley?

182
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:32,660
No, I don't.

183
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,699
Once upon a time, Taoyuan Valley

184
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,619
was just a village in the mountains.

185
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,220
People here worked hard to practice martial skills

186
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:43,499
and to study.

187
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,220
Every generation followed the routine.

188
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,540
That's how the achievements in Taoyuan Valley

189
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:47,819
were made.

190
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,579
Yes,

191
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,180
in the family rules

192
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,180
Mrs. Yu gave me,

193
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,499
there's something about it.

194
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,139
No rules, no society.

195
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,619
Without

196
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,420
the rules left by our ancestors,

197
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,499
we couldn't

198
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,579
be how we look like now.

199
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:05,900
Be respected.

200
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,139
Win a place

201
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,259
in the martial arts world.

202
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,459
So what you said just now

203
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,660
is really not in keeping with

204
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,819
the Taoyuan Valley's rules.

205
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,660
Sorry,

206
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,660
I was wrong.

207
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,660
What took her so long inside?

208
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:27,979
Is everything good?

209
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,260
Maybe

210
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:31,380
or may not.

211
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:33,819
What do you mean?

212
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:35,420
Severe punishment can be avoided,

213
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,859
but a little punishment can't.

214
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,059
It depends on the attitude

215
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,739
of Mr Yu.

216
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:41,140
Yu Linfeng?

217
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:42,660
Why?

218
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:43,859
For example,

219
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,459
if it were someone I loved

220
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:46,620
and she did something wrong,

221
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:47,699
or were thrown into jail,

222
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,699
I would try my best to defend her,

223
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,300
or take the blame for her.

224
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:58,260
Why are you here?

225
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,859
You're here. Why can't I?

226
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,939
You...

227
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,859
Mr Qu

228
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,380
I need to talk to you.

229
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,380
He said he liked me.

230
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:18,180
But when Su Zhuozhuo asked him to come over, he left at once.

231
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,339
What a playboy!

232
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,500
Qiuer

233
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,739
You'll live in

234
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,660
Taoyuan Valley.

235
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,859
What you said just now

236
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,219
is fine

237
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,099
to me.

238
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:30,420
But remember,

239
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:31,780
you can't

240
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,140
repeat these words

241
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:34,380
in front of my parents

242
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,500
in case they'll get upset

243
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:37,859
and the others will laugh at us.

244
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,699
Ok,

245
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,380
I see.

246
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,500
Am I being too harsh?

247
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,900
Miss Su wants to talk to me

248
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,660
about the womenfolk gathering yesterday?

249
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,459
You know it?

250
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,180
Yesterday in the womenfolk gathering,

251
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:18,459
everyone was drunk.

252
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,099
You were the only one

253
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,300
who was sober

254
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,500
but looked flustered.

255
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:25,660
Yes,

256
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,339
I prepared a pot of liquor,

257
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,979
but that's for Jin Baiwan.

258
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:31,500
How did I know

259
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,699
that Miss Jin drank it?

260
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,739
I did it.

261
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:36,939
Report me or punish me,

262
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,059
it's up to you.

263
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:39,819
I was to ask you

264
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:40,660
for explanation,

265
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,300
but it was rare

266
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,979
to see Miss Baiwan's

267
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,059
cute expression after she was drunk.

268
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,819
I'll forget what you did.

269
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,300
But it can't happen again.

270
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,180
But she is just

271
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,380
a cook.

272
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,059
Identity doesn't matter

273
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,739
to me.

274
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:59,739
No matter she is a cook or an escort,

275
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,660
even if I don't know

276
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:02,540
her identity,

277
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:04,380
I still like her.

278
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,819
It doesn't matter to me.

279
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:12,900
Ok,

280
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,660
since you don't like me,

281
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,540
I, Su Zhuozhuo, won't bother you anymore.

282
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:19,300
I'll find a man

283
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,699
who is cuter, taller

284
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,260
and better than you.

285
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,660
You're frank.

286
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:26,939
I'm sure that your dream will come true soon.

287
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:30,620
But Mr Qu,

288
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,059
I've known you for, like two years.

289
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,459
I feel like

290
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,180
that since you got to know Jin Baiwan,

291
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:37,780
you've changed a lot.

292
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:40,979
Because

293
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:42,339
it's her.

294
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,059
What are you talking about?

295
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:48,540
What's to chat about?

296
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:49,660
It's been long.

297
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,699
Miss Muqiu

298
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,219
Baiwan, I'm toast.

299
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:01,099
What's wrong?

300
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:02,219
What happened?

301
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:03,339
Brother Shu

302
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,459
He knew everything.

303
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,540
What... what did he know?

304
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,540
Everything.

305
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:13,859
Well,

306
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,099
what did you tell him?

307
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,780
Everything.

308
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,219
So

309
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,339
he

310
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,500
must hate me so much now.

311
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:22,459
Mr Yu volunteered

312
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,380
to take the blame for you,

313
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,260
which means he liked you.

314
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,780
Yes,

315
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:27,500
he must.

316
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:29,380
You were just drunk.

317
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,459
It's not as serious as killing.

318
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:32,699
But he

319
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,099
doesn't talk to me now.

320
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,059
Well, well,

321
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,500
what happened in the womenfolk gathering is my fault.

322
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:43,859
I'll figure out a way

323
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:44,780
to clarify for you.

324
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,219
What are you doing here?

325
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,579
I'm here to help for sure.

326
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,939
With Baiwan alone,

327
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,459
it can't be dealt with properly.

328
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,900
How about

329
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,540
Miss Su giving a hand?

330
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,739
She...

331
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,500
What can she do?

332
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,099
I...

333
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:18,979
You're a doctor.

334
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,660
Yes.

335
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:22,699
I've got a plan.

336
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,059
Relax,

337
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,780
if I can help,

338
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,059
I'll try my best to help you.

339
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:29,500
Since that,

340
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,420
how about

341
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:31,939
counting me in?

342
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,380
-You?  -You?

343
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,579
He's coming.

344
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:35,300
Get ready. Get ready.

345
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,219
What should I do?

346
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,099
Baiwan, what happened?

347
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,420
Miss Muqiu is in danger

348
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,660
because of Mr Yu.

349
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:47,300
What did you say?

350
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,739
What's wrong with Qiuer?

351
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,540
She said

352
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,180
that even if she gets terrible,

353
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:57,780
I can't tell you that.

354
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:58,780
Qiuer's sick?

355
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,620
Could it work?

356
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,699
I say it could, then it will.

357
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:04,420
It will work.

358
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:05,339
Come here.

359
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:10,140
He's coming.

360
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,739
He's coming.

361
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:11,500
He's here.

362
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,180
Speak.

363
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:16,500
Say what you plan to say.

364
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:21,339
How's my condition?

365
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:23,500
You're anxious.

366
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,300
Your blood vessels were blocked.

367
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:27,540
Miss Jin

368
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:29,459
Although you're young now,

369
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,579
you kept doing this

370
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,420
to your body,

371
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,420
I can't cure you

372
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,819
even though my medical skills are superb.

373
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,260
She looked good this morning.

374
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,380
Why all of a sudden...

375
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,300
The womenfolk gathering.

376
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,059
After Miss Muqiu knew she was wrong,

377
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,819
she was badly ill when she was back.

378
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,500
And after she woke up,

379
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,500
she kept locking herself

380
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,420
in her room

381
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,500
and copying the family rules

382
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,459
and women's commandments without anything to eat and drink.

383
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,339
She didn't listen to my advice.

384
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,219
Finally

385
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:55,380
she was willing to go to the doctor.

386
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,219
Come here. Let me feel your pulse.

387
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,699
You don't need to worry about me.

388
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,420
I'd better copy

389
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,420
my family rules first.

390
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:10,939
Miss Muqiu

391
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,059
As what I told you,

392
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:13,620
you need to stop working so hard.

393
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,339
But it's the only thing

394
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,699
I can do now.

395
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,660
Otherwise Brother Shu

396
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,500
will be angrier.

397
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,140
Since that,

398
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,459
why did you ask me to

399
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,660
come here?

400
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:26,819
Qiuer

401
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:28,979
Watch out.

402
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:31,900
Shu

403
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:33,579
Why are you here?

404
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:34,660
What did you do

405
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:35,500
to yourself?

406
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,140
It's all my bad.

407
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,979
I'm too inelegant.

408
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
And I don't know the rules of Taoyuan Valley.

409
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,660
But relax,

410
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,500
I'll work hard to learn

411
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,819
and to improve.

412
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,699
My silly girl.

413
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,699
Silly girl.

414
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:58,780
It's all my fault.

415
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,900
I'm sorry that I've always been too hard on you.

416
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,699
It's my fault.

417
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,500
It works.

418
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:10,260
It's all my acting.

419
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,500
Miss Muqiu

420
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:31,500
Qiuer

421
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,219
Qiuer

422
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,180
We don't perform the formal wedding ceremony yet,

423
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,500
and there are others here.

424
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:39,780
I just

425
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:41,259
want to make sure

426
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,340
that if you like me or not.

427
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:48,580
Of course, I like you.

428
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,380
Qiuer

429
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,860
You're my only one.

430
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:01,820
Oh.

431
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,259
You lied to me.

432
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,180
No, Brother Shu.

433
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:18,060
It's all my bad.

434
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:18,739
It's all my plan.

435
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,939
It's none of her business.

436
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:24,420
What should I do?

437
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,259
You said you would help.

438
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,860
Think of a plan.

439
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,939
Are you sure that you want my help?

440
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,499
Of course.

441
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,900
Ok, don't be jealous.

442
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,900
You were out of control in the gathering.

443
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:35,739
I took it as a mistake.

444
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,860
But now you

445
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,739
learn to cheat.

446
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:39,820
I...

447
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,499
Doctor Su

448
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,340
Please tell me

449
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,979
how Qiuer is now frankly.

450
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,860
Miss Jin's condition...

451
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:52,660
I...

452
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,299
Mr Yu

453
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,499
In my view,

454
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:57,660
this

455
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,939
is not Miss Jin's fault.

456
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,620
Why?

457
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,499
She

458
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,499
learns to cheat now.

459
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,060
Cheat?

460
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,299
This is what Miss Jin

461
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,340
copies by herself.

462
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:12,979
In such a short time,

463
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:14,900
if she doesn't work hard,

464
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,340
how is it possible for her to accomplish so many?

465
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:17,459
Is this

466
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,499
what you called cheating?

467
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:21,180
But she lied that she was sick.

468
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,060
She works hard

469
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,259
and feels sick lately.

470
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,539
In order to cover

471
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,380
her sick look,

472
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:28,939
she puts on the makeup.

473
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,259
Why did you say that she lied?

474
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,900
Right.

475
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,779
Mr Yu

476
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,499
Yan School has practiced medicine for generations.

477
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,539
We won't practice fraud.

478
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,140
Yes.

479
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:42,340
Miss Muqiu

480
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:43,699
I told you not to pretend to be good.

481
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,900
You refused me.

482
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,699
Qiuer

483
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,779
You...

484
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,979
What's more, Mr Yu,

485
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:55,699
for you, Miss Jin learns

486
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,979
unique romance lately.

487
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,299
As for her hard work

488
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,380
I've seen it all

489
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:00,180
and I've felt sorry for her.

490
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,660
Why did you know all these?

491
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:07,380
As Miss Jin's bosom friend...

492
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,939
Bosom...

493
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,660
Bosom friend...

494
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
Bosom friend?

495
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:18,340
If there's a girl

496
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:19,140
who is half as good to me

497
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,979
as Miss Jin,

498
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:23,459
I'll have no regrets.

499
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,420
But what a pity.

500
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,140
Miss Jin

501
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:28,219
had an engagement since she was young.

502
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:29,299
I

503
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,900
have to regret it forever.

504
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,340
Qiuer engaged with me long ago.

505
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,499
Please behave yourself.

506
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,539
Yes, what are you talking about?

507
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:52,660
I'm not.

508
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:53,779
Look at how much Miss Jin

509
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,100
has compromised

510
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,219
while Mr Yu

511
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,340
is getting more and more domineering.

512
00:21:57,979 --> 00:21:58,620
Too much.

513
00:21:59,380 --> 00:21:59,939
Too much.

514
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:02,939
Under the circumstances,

515
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,900
the one who should reflect is not Miss Jin,

516
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,459
but Mr Yu.

517
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,939
Miss Jin, what do you think?

518
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,180
Stop it.

519
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,299
Yes, stop it.

520
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:21,620
In Miss Jin's view,

521
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,860
she's now exhausted,

522
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,779
and she hopes that you won't

523
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:25,580
bother her.

524
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:27,459
Please, Mr Yu.

525
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:38,779
Mr Yu

526
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,660
Mr Qu

527
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,820
I didn't know you had this side.

528
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,060
What did you do?

529
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,340
Help Miss Jin.

530
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:52,060
I asked you to help,

531
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,459
not to destroy.

532
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,340
If Mr Yu really takes

533
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,100
what you said for serious,

534
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:57,459
and if he doesn't marry Miss Muqiu,

535
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,380
you're toast.

536
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,660
What if

537
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,060
I give a hand

538
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:02,060
in their marriage,

539
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,660
what will you do?

540
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,979
Impossible.

541
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:06,820
How about making a bet?

542
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,459
What?

543
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:09,340
Let's go.

544
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,380
Let me show me a place.

545
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:11,660
Where?

546
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,340
To test my words, of course.

547
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:29,699
Why did you bring me here?

548
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:34,340
Qiuer

549
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,699
Who?

550
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:36,900
It's me.

551
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,299
Brother Shu

552
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,779
Qiuer

553
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,699
I shouldn't bother you at night.

554
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,219
But I really feel upset.

555
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,499
I was wrong today.

556
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,939
I'm sorry.

557
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,699
No,

558
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,140
you don't need to apologize.

559
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,299
I have to.

560
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,219
You're exhausted,

561
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,219
but I was filled with suspicion.

562
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,580
It was a terrible mistake.

563
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:20,860
Could...

564
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:24,299
Could you please forgive me?

565
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,219
Yes, I could.

566
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,060
Great!

567
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,420
You gave me your whole heart.

568
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,140
I won't let you down.

569
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:32,420
Me too.

570
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,539
I can't believe you were right.

571
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,140
It seems that I won.

572
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,739
Don't you ask me

573
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:39,620
what I want?

574
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,660
What are you thinking about?

575
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,380
And

576
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,539
your bosom friend...

577
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:47,860
Lord Qu Zheng

578
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,900
I heard

579
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,660
that you went to his villa a lot recently.

580
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,699
I went there for Baiwan.

581
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,060
It has nothing to do with Lord Qu.

582
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,459
That's good.

583
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,299
Don't get me wrong.

584
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:00,380
I'm for the best of you.

585
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:01,620
In my opinion,

586
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,100
Lord Qu Zheng

587
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,340
is

588
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:06,539
nothing

589
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,259
like a gentleman.

590
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,820
Please rest assured.

591
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,219
In my heart,

592
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,340
there's only one person.

593
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:21,499
That's you.

594
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,340
Me too.

595
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,100
You're the only one

596
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:31,140
in my heart.

597
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,660
Baiwan said that I was

598
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,620
a vengeful man.

599
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,219
She's right.

600
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:07,939
Who?

601
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,900
What are you doing?

602
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:19,420
Freeze.

603
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:23,820
Baiwan and I

604
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,180
are really connected.

605
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,539
Without me telling her,

606
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,499
she has already known what I want.

607
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,499
Why don't you go

608
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,699
and tell Su Zhuozhuo?

609
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,299
Zheng

610
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:49,699
The wedding will be held the day after tomorrow.

611
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,459
Tonight the warehouse of Taoyuan Valley

612
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,380
will definitely be open.

613
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,499
Tonight

614
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:58,820
I'll meet him.

615
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,299
Baiwan

616
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:05,539
In my whole life,

617
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:07,900
I don't want to

618
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,620
spend my time with anyone else except you.

619
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,699
Why are you here again?

620
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,180
What are you doing here?

621
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,860
Why are you here?

622
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:31,180
I also want to ask you

623
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:32,739
that you run out in the middle of the day,

624
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,860
are you not afraid of being punished?

625
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:34,979
There's no one here.

626
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:36,499
You can tell me the truth.

627
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:38,820
What's the truth?

628
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,499
How could you leave me alone

629
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,100
for so long?

630
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,420
What happened?

631
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,979
Qi, what are you talking about?

632
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,060
Qi

633
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:55,299
Why do you still call me Qi?

634
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:56,539
You really don't know me?

635
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,739
Didn't you tell me

636
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,779
that your name is Qi?

637
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,739
(She really forgot me.)

638
00:28:03,939 --> 00:28:04,539
Since that,

639
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:05,820
I'll take you out first.

640
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:08,140
What are you doing?

641
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,060
Is it because

642
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,699
that I helped you in the kitchen,

643
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,259
so you...

644
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:17,699
Listen,

645
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,100
I'm married.

646
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,259
You mean Qu Zheng?

647
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:22,340
Yes,

648
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:23,979
he's my husband.

649
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:25,779
And he's the Lord of Tingqin Garden.

650
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,180
Behave yourself.

651
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,219
I'm an escort of Jin's Escort Agency.

652
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,499
An escort?

653
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:31,699
Don't you know you...

654
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,299
Baiwan

655
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:33,459
Miss Muqiu

656
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:34,939
I'm leaving.

657
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,860
Behave yourself.

658
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:37,620
Come here, come.

659
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:38,140
Miss Muqiu

660
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:41,660
What's wrong?

661
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,499
Nothing.

662
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,140
Now go get dressed with me.

663
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:44,539
Lets' go.

664
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,979
One, two, three, take a breath.

665
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:51,860
It's Mrs. Yu's bad,

666
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,259
saying that in the rule of Taoyuan Valley,

667
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:56,420
we should eat no more than three bites of each dish.

668
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,739
Well, what's wrong with you?

669
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,580
When I get hungry, I go out for a midnight snack.

670
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:02,900
So I get weight.

671
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:04,299
Miss Muqiu

672
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:05,140
Come, let's do it again.

673
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,939
One, two, three,

674
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,620
take a deep breath.

675
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:10,499
Ok, we made it.

676
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,180
Is it pretty?

677
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,060
Yes, so pretty.

678
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:14,939
Baiwan

679
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,499
I got this feeling.

680
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:19,380
Mr Qu

681
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,259
really likes you.

682
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:24,459
Maybe

683
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,380
you'll

684
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,420
wear your own wedding dress soon.

685
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,499
Actually last night

686
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,299
he confessed to me.

687
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,820
He confessed to you?

688
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,979
Keep your voice down.

689
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:35,459
What's your plan?

690
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,620
Miss Muqiu

691
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,820
What do you think I should do?

692
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,499
As far as I think,

693
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,580
you should

694
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:41,779
make a cake, send it over,

695
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:42,860
and tell him

696
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,140
that you say yes.

697
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,060
Then you'll

698
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:48,580
live a happy life.

699
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,739
Your marriage is settled.

700
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:56,860
I'm relieved.

701
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,219
Escorting all the way,

702
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,299
the cook and the hero

703
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:05,180
get married and live in harmony and happiness.

704
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,900
What a good topic for novels!

705
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,380
I have to write it down.

706
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:10,180
Miss Muqiu

707
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,499
Didn't you say

708
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,219
that Mr Yu hates novels most?

709
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,620
You're getting married.

710
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,580
If he finds out,

711
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:16,340
what should you do?

712
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,620
Yes,

713
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:20,499
if he knows

714
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,699
I'm a novel writer,

715
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,180
I'll be screwed.

716
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,499
So

717
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:27,900
novels and Mr Yu,

718
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,900
which one is more important?

719
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,820
Both.

720
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:31,900
Ok, I think you just want to write novels.

721
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:33,219
Of course, I do.

722
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,420
As long as he doesn't find out,

723
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,660
I'll keep writing even if I need to hide under the bed.

724
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:39,499
Miss Muqiu

725
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,499
You should eat less.

726
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,820
Or what to do with the wedding?

727
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,580
It's like you're skinny.

728
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:44,900
I want to lose weight too.

729
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:25,259
Who?

730
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:26,660
You guys, follow him.

731
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
The rest of you keep guarding.

732
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,900
Tell Young Master right now.

733
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:45,340
Young Master

734
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:46,299
Someone's attacking the warehouse.

735
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,499
Who are you?

736
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,259
Breaking through into the warehouse of Taoyuan Valley.

737
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:52,979
Are you looking for death?

738
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,900
Boss, don't we kill him?

739
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,699
Killing Young Master of Taoyuan Valley

740
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,939
is seeking for troubles.

741
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:29,939
Take the saussurea quickly.

742
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,459
Yes.

743
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,180
Lord, that's it.

744
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,900
Doctor Demon said it was the one.

745
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,820
Put it away.

746
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,420
Yes.

747
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,499
Stop, stop, stop.

748
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:56,219
Freeze, freeze.

749
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:58,380
Get them. Freeze.
